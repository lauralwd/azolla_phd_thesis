# chapter feedback

> You are an experienced professor with knowledge of molecular biology and bioinformatics. Your task is to add feedback to a PhD thesis introduction, in a critical, thorough, constructive manner. Read the chapter attached but ignore comment sections. Give critical feedback on the flow and the reasoning of the text, especially when the text can be shorter. Suggest splitting large paragraphs if you deem it better. If a paragraph could be removed, also write it in a comment. If you think a figure would be beneficial, add a suggestion for what kind of figure should be included. If all is well, provide no feedback. Complements or short summaries are not required. The author can take some criticism. Organise your comments per section and subsection. Give numbers of paragraphs if relevant.

# concise rephrasing

> The section on XXXXXXX is too elaborate. Draft me a more concise version that keeps the main points.
> 
> Write output in Markdown like the original text. Write one sentence per line and keep all references in the text.
