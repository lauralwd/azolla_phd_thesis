This thesis discusses the genomics of the intricate symbiosis between the genus _Azolla_, its cyanobacterial partner _T. azollae_ and additional bacterial partners.
This tightly intertwined mutualism makes _Azolla_ an interesting novel-crop independent of Nitrogen fertiliser, as well as a notorious weed threatening aquatic ecosystems.
Study of the _Azolla_ genus can favour a botanic lens, by exploring the genomics of the first fern genome and shedding light on an under-represented branch of plant research.
It can favour a plant-microbe-interaction lens, juxtaposing the obligate mutualism of the host and the cyanobiont vs the seemingly free to leave bacterial co-inhabitants.
And it can favour a agronomic view, controlling _Azolla_ development, growth and dissemination to employ _Azolla_ as a protein crop independent of controversial nitrogen fertilisation.
In this theses, I try to find and light all these perspective on the _Azolla_ symbiosis.
To do so, I develop new workflows to process data of genomic, transcriptomic and metagenomic origin.
I will discuss my work in X main discussion points, namely:

1. The genus metagenome: a consistent partnership or modular accessory genome
2. Methodological advances
3. Future research directions
4. Azolla for the bio-based economy

# The genus metagenome: a consistent partnership or modular accessory genome

## Genus metagenome

Genus metagenome. Explaining it's consistency from a systems biology perspective.

- genus metagenome concept is completely new
- holobiont like
- Example of how a systems biology view on the genus, tells us about the relations between a single plant in your hand and the microbes within.

Subdivide in the metagenome

- Nostocs are all near-identical and heavily degraded because of evo-bottleneck
- no such degradation in other microbes, hence the 'additional' microbes are not exclusively vertically transfered
  -Not so crazy similarity of other bacteria --> this result isn't even in a chapter... That needs fixing.

## Evolution and transfer

Transmission modes

- fixedness in genus suggests so.

The ecosystem can't be exclusively vertical transmission

- There must be some flux in and out of the ecosystem for these bacteria. How would they otherwise survive the bottleneck?
- clam shell paper is nice here

## Function

Fixed consistent partners vs ITSNTS (Its The Song Not The Singers)  in flux community that conserves functions.

- The community is a like, but not identical. Is it the species or their functions that are preserved.
- A community may be seen as a sequence logo rather than a fixed sequence, probabilities af a certain taxon ocuring rather than a simple list.
- Evolutionary presure to keep the species in depends on their function in the mini-ecosystem.
- human gut microbiome paper

Function: completing small ecosystem can be function enough.

- They may be living off debris from Nazollae, or the leaf pocket in general and provide a cycle like that.
- Over-romatic to think that rhizobiales also fix nitrogen, or burkholderiales promote growth etc.

Environment vs multipartitie organism.

- vesicles

## other symbioses

Comparison to other symbioses

- Compare to other non-rhizosphere symbioses.
- Compare to insect-microbe symbioses.
- Are plant symbioses more multipartite, conclusion for general plant-bac symbioses?

symbiosis functioning: CSP?

# Methodology

- and more in the P&P notes

## A system in which microbes can be added and subtracted at will

- If we conclude that additional microbes are iterchangable, we should be able to reproduce this in the lab somehow.
- Shoot APEX is the place to be

  - First fern genomes, we're only starting to scratch the surface.  Plus the annotations aren't exactly great.
- What does Azolla research contribute to PI as a whole

```chatgpt critisism
   - Clarity on Endophyte Roles: While you’ve identified persistent endophytes, their functional roles remain speculative. In the general discussion, it would strengthen your argument to acknowledge this limitation and suggest experimental approaches to verify their contributions to the symbiosis.
   - Balance between Holism and Reductionism: While advocating for a systems biology approach, it’s important to recognize that reductionist methods are still valuable. Discuss how integrating both approaches can provide a more comprehensive understanding.
   - Addressing Contradictory Evidence: Some studies suggest the presence of multiple cyanobacterial species in Azolla. In your discussion, consider reconciling these differences, possibly by examining methodological variations or ecological factors.
   - Ethical Nuances in Symbiosis Manipulation: When discussing breeding and genetic manipulation, delve deeper into the ethical complexities. Consider the potential impacts on natural populations and the environment.
   - Methodological Transparency: Ensure that any limitations in your metagenomic analyses, such as potential biases in sequencing or assembly, are openly discussed. This transparency will add credibility to your conclusions.

# Notes

Sarah says: discuss three take home messages from your thesis. And maybe one thing that is the biggest weakness, or also the biggest strength.

Possible tak-homes:

- Consistent bacterial symbionts in Azolla suggest a selective advantage to the symbiosis as a whole
  - Find recent papers to back/refute that
  - What could the advantage be
  - Are there recent systems with a similar consistent microbiome (that is not root)
- Symbiosis genomics for sustainable agriculture
  - lot's of hard work, feasibility
  - Task of a research lab or of industry?

# left-over notes from the hidden treasures chapter

I have said nothing of membrane vesicles from both cyano's and bact observed by
at least @Zheng2009

Is this a small group of bacteria maintained by the plant, or conversely,
How do these bacteria co-exist in this special niche with generational bottleneck.
Hypothesis: all persistent partners have some specialised function in a bigger
cooperation, a function which they are selected upon.
   question: are persistent microbes prone to pseudogenation
   question: are persistent microbes evolving slower than a representative
   subset of their genus/family.
   question: cyano's are mobile, are these bacteria mobile in order to board
   "noahs ark" to the next genration.
Alternate hypothesis: Bacteria are present in low abundances until their specific
"usecase" comes into effect.
In other words: we see a snapshot of a community, but that does not imply
equilibrium.
Alternative hypothesis: these bacteria "battle out" other bacteria and hence
function as a leaf pocket immune system
Another idea: the generational bottleneck undermines a major requirement for
igh diversity ecosystems: spatial diversification and hetrogeneïty.
More important: the generational bottleneck should imply muller's ratchet unless
some genetic exchange is happening.
Perhaps a semi open system which allows for more microbes to enter and replace
damaged ones.
That's why these microbes don't show signs of degradation...
How then does _N. azollae_ escape this... Is multiple genome coppies sufficient?

The leaf pocket ecosystem:
_N. azollae_ is an autotroph in a highly closed leaf pocket.
Presumably, all elements that can't be fixed photosynthetically or with energy
from photosynthesis, are delivered by the plant.
What about the excretory and dead _N. azollae_ material however
It's unreasonable to expect _N. azollae_ has the genetic capacity to completely
recycle it's own decaying material.
Perhaps the plant can remove this organic waste itself, just as it can remove
fixed N and supply all nutrients for _N. azollae_
Alternatively, the bacteria inside the leaf pocket may form some closed nutrient
cycle.
The "additional" microbiome feeds of _N. azollae_ waste, decomposing it to
inorganic form to be recycled again by _N. azollae_ (or the plant).
One wonders if the low abundance of "additional microbes" is sufficient to
fulfil that role in the cycle however...
Again, it may be "waiting" there for a later life stage of the leaf pocket, we
sampled material that's "too fresh".
Also, there is presumablyy no requirement to close the nutrient cycle since the
plant has to be able to support _N. azollae_ with nutrients.
Perhaps
With ideas from [@rillig2019]

Again a completely different hypothesis: The "additional microbiome" adds some
function that was lost/damaged in _N. azollae_, perhaps connecting to the reason
_N. azollae_ can't be cultered.

ITSNTS versus "simple altruism"

\newpage
Microbiology and ecology need, in the end, a reductionist approach to piece
appart the nuts and bolts co-existance.
We need at least a way to manipulate the microbial community of a plant organ,
or simulate this in microcosms to come to the level of hypothesis testing.
[@rillig2019]

Given systematic occurence, are we looking at a ITSNTS picture or a holobiont
picture.
Here, I'm not particularly looking at functions so I can't really see ITSNTS,
but does the holobiont break down if I go to deeper taxonomy, and is that even meaningful.
[@FordDoolittle2018]
The main ITSNTS argument against the holobiont is the too-many-parents-means-no-
parents-at-all-argument, with which I agree.
However, this argument assumes complete lossy/random inheritance.
The holobiont argument stands if inheritance is systematic, if the genetic
material and phenotype of the child generation represents that of their parent population.
Counting parents and assuming randomness ignores that the persistance of genetic
material can move in a range of strictness.
On the one hand (near) 100% strict, such as _N. azollae_

If we conclude there is strict holobiont like inheritance of a slection of
microbes,
with that bottleneck maternal mechanism,
then why is this beneficial to recruiting symbionts from the environment as so
many hosts do.
Is this a matter of not having the tools to do so (as a fern) Seems not, for
facultative cyanobacterial and moss symbioses exist as well. Hence at leaset the
potential for facultative symbiosis was present in the common ancestor of ferns
and mosses.

1. assuming variation in a population of microbes across members of a host
species
2. assume systematic inheritance of organisms and genes via megaspores (1 parent
  maternal transmission)
3. if these have differential bennefit, there's classic darwinian evolution

This scenario is very different from rhizosphere microbiota,
the many-partent-argument.

ITSNTS and redundancy in the mags we find. Redundancy in singers implies
redunancy in the parts of the song they sing.

microbes recycling dead azolla and making nutrients available again.

Pose that the Azolla-microbe system is just a (collection) of niches (songs) to
be fulfilled (sung) by microbes/genes.
Now asume that these functions are reasonably generic and could be reqruited
from the environment (as Moss-cyano, legume-rhizobia).
Corollary then, these functions were reqruited from the environment in some
Ancestral Azolla-microbe state before they were transfered vertically by the host.
What makes it beneficial to fix these processes/genes/genomes in maternal
transmission?
How does the drastic reduction in gene pool and risk of genetic drift pay back?
Especially given the current default is still reqruitment of microbes from the
environment, again mosses, legumes, all rhizome associated bacteria.
To clarify our thinking, let's consider other systems where this is the case:
lichen, some insects, more?.
Lichen are specialised to grow in harsh conditions, nutrient poor, the odds of
encountering the required functions in the genomes of bacteria already present
may be so low that the lichens benefit from the safety of carying them in spores.
This assumtion is not the case for Azolla, Azolla is part of a family (or even
  order) of (semi) aquatic ferns.
Nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria should be available in the potential living e
nvironment even of what I envision as the most recent common ancestor of Azolla.

If the host plant provides niches to microbes, thereby defining the processes/songs,
 and even just a part of microbes is systematic part of that song (permanent singers).
Then does it even matter if part of the singers is swapped in and out?
Yes if we're talking about evolution, for selection can only occur if the traits
and associated fittness of one generation are transfered to the next generation.
This may be partially untrue if the song is defined already in advance by the
permanent particants/singers (Host and Nostoc).
Evolution of these heritable parts of the hologenome may define in advance the
niche to be filled, even if the gene to fill that niche is one another genome.
How then, does this differ from traditional co-evolution...?

Selection for reduced genome size lower in extracellular symbionts than
 intracellular ones?

\newpage

## CSP fragment

Many plant species are known to interact with bacteria systematically and even transmit these systematically [@Frank2018; @Pinto-Carbo2018], but the mechanisms underpinning symbiosis are often unclear.
The best known mechanism is termed the common symbiosis pathway, variations of this common pathway facilitate both Rhizobiales-legume and mycohorriza symbiosis [@Genre2016].
But other symbioses, like Cuanobacteria-plant symbises and ... , are not facilitated by this pathway [@Li2018] `more examples would be nice`.
Mining the genomes of symbiotic bacteria already hidden away in host sequencing data may allow comparative genomics of symbionts on a large scale and further elucidation of the mechanisms of plant-microbe symbioses.

`root nodule bacteria diversity; disporiensis diversity`

In microbial ecology, natural low diversity, low complexity populations are rare.
This is such an example, perhaps many plant-microbe associations are.
The plant genome does add complexity, but other than that ...
[@Rillig2019]

\newpage

## Bacteria associated with plants as a modular subset of the hologenome

Microbial genomes may encode and convey traits to a host when in symbiosis.
The most obvious example is _Azolla_ its independence of nitrogen in the surrounding water or sediment, a trait conveyed by _N. azollae_.
Bacterial genomes are substantially more fluid in their structure and content than their eukaryotic hosts.
Additionally, bacteria may leave or enter the symbiosis.
Consequently, the functions conveyed by bacterial genomes are more easily lost and acquired.
This modular and variant subset of the hologenome can provide a bigger pool of genes and functions for the holobiont to be selected on.
Current ecological and evolutionary terminology may be sufficient to describe and understand a host and symbionts as individual units [@Douglas2016].
We argue the terms holobiont and hologenome are not new concepts per say, but still may be helpfull in reasoning and communicatiing about an ever increasing complexity in host-microbiome research.
We subscribe to the view of a holobiont as a modular agglomeration of individuals who may move in and out of symbiosis with each other.
The assocation of those indivuduals may be of differing consistency, but is mostly constant.
For example, reliable vertical transfer has been proven as the exclusive method of transfer, as is the case for _N. azollae_, we deem using holobiont as a concept to describe a single unit is justified.
Just as it is justified to include plastig genomes in the concept of a species' genome.
Vertical transfer may be established but not as fixed as is the case for _Azolla_, as is the case in bivalve bacterial symbionts [@Russel2020].
Still, since the association and consequential selection presure are practically ubiquitous, the holobiont term is meaningful.
Alternatively, symbionts may need to reinnoculate their host annew every generation as is the case for Rhizobiales-legume symbioses.
...
No particular mode of transmission of genetic material is more or less relevant to be included in a hologenome, instead the holobiont term must be a usefull concept in research applied appropriately.
