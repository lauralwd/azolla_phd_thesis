# Forever together: One nostoc azollae is symbiont to all Azolla species
\label{forever together}

### excerpt
How similar (dis)similar are all *Nostoc azollae* in all *azolla* species. We take the data of chapter 3 and start comparing them.
Additionally, we re-assemble the galgenwaard strain with nanopore sequencing to investigate structural changes and transposon activity.
All nostocs are alike in terms of genome structure and gene content. Being more than 99% similar, they are one species.  
Transposon position is conserved and the symbiosis formed rapidly in the common ancestor of all Azolla species, after which evolution of the symbiont came to a standstill and the different azolla strains speciated.

### narrative

**Azolla genus**

* How similar are the Nostoc azollae strains
    - anvio pangenomics and ANI figure. Gene content is the same
    - phylogenomic tree Azolla genus Nostocs only, mirror with chloroplast tree
    - all but A. nilotica are the same. nilotica is different OTU (stricly speaking)

* How similar are they genomically --> whole genome alignments
   - single introduction in Azolla genus

**genomics**

* Is the published structure correct, complete, and unchanged
   - Giulio's figure, yes the structure is unchanged but two plasmids are actually one.
   - Shared pseudogenes, shared transposons by Giulio
* Is the gene content of N. azollae special, symbiotic toolkit?
   - pangenomics multiple nostocs
* which genes are functional in all species?
   - pseudogenation master table
* When did the transposons move (shown in the tree)
   - tricky...
   - single introduction in Azolla genus and rapid degradation before Azolla speciations!
* RNAseq data, compared to gene models, expression data.
* Sufficient data for puryfying selection? Likely not.

**Evolution**

* So much debate about which species it is, can we sovle that here?
   - phylogenomic tree nostoc, trichormus, anabaena.
* Pseudogenation has come to a standstill
* bottleneck effect, Muellers ratchet?
   - might polyploidy be involved.

lacking immunity in N. azollae -> plant must keep its house clean

CAS targetted phosphate transporter...?

**Morphology**

* encapsulating from the meristem colony --?
* pictures from Erbil

* Confocal images of Anna in which the microsporocarps lose the Cyano's while the megasporocarps keep these.
  - both sporocarps gaining the Nostocs was published [@Perkins1993], but nog the losing part.


**Discussion**

polyploidy in *N. azollae*

is there restructuring in the resting stages of *Nostoc azollae*

A new co-evolution tree between nostoc and chloroplast with the two novel species nicely separate and based on several SCMG

conservedness --> selection presure of presumable symbiosis important genes

embed in nostoc/trichormus/anabaena tree for more definitive placing.

* Do we find more expressed regions with the RNAseq data
   - We do, needs propper annotation.

How does it retain genome stability with (plant) generation bottleneck

Are cyanobacteria often polyplo√Ød,
