abstract = {Nitrification is a key stage in the nitrogen cycle; it enables the transformation of nitrogen into an oxidized, inorganic state1,2. The availability of nitrates produced by this process often limits primary productivity and is an important determinant in plant community ecology and biodiversity3,4,5,6. Chemoautotrophic prokaryotes are recognized as the main facilitators of this process7, although heterotrophic nitrification by fungi may be significant under certain conditions8. However, there has been neither biochemical nor ecological evidence to support nitrification by photoautotrophic plants. Here we show how certain legumes that accumulate the toxin, 3-nitropropionic acid, generate oxidized inorganic nitrogen in their shoots, which is returned to the soil in their litter. In nitrogen-fixing populations this ‘new' nitrate and nitrite can be derived from the assimilation of nitrogen gas. Normally, the transformation of elemental nitrogen from the atmosphere into a fixed oxidized form (as nitrate) is represented in the nitrogen cycle as a multiphasic process involving several different organisms. We show how this can occur in a single photoautotrophic organism, representing a previously undescribed feature of this biogeochemical cycle.},

abstract = {Ferns are the closest sister group to all seed plants, yet little is known about their genomes other than that they are generally colossal. Here, we report on the genomes of Azolla filiculoides and Salvinia cucullata (Salviniales) and present evidence for episodic whole-genome duplication in ferns—one at the base of ‘core leptosporangiates' and one specific to Azolla. One fern-specific gene that we identified, recently shown to confer high insect resistance, seems to have been derived from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. Azolla coexists in a unique symbiosis with N2-fixing cyanobacteria, and we demonstrate a clear pattern of cospeciation between the two partners. Furthermore, the Azolla genome lacks genes that are common to arbuscular mycorrhizal and root nodule symbioses, and we identify several putative transporter genes specific to Azolla–cyanobacterial symbiosis. These genomic resources will help in exploring the biotechnological potential of Azolla and address fundamental questions in the evolution of plant life.},

abstract = {In the carnivorous plant genus Genlisea a unique lobster pot trapping mechanism supplements nutrition in nutrient-poor habitats. A wide spectrum of microbes frequently occurs in Genlisea's leaf-derived traps without clear relevance for Genlisea carnivory. We sequenced the metatranscriptomes of subterrestrial traps versus the aerial chlorophyll-containing leaves of G. nigrocaulis and of G. hispidula. Ribosomal RNA assignment revealed soil-borne microbial diversity in Genlisea traps, with 92 genera of 19 phyla present in more than one sample. Microbes from 16 of these phyla including proteobacteria, green algae, amoebozoa, fungi, ciliates and metazoans, contributed additionally short-lived mRNA to the metatranscriptome. Furthermore, transcripts of 438 members of hydrolases (e.g. proteases, phosphatases, lipases), mainly resembling those of metazoans, ciliates and green algae, were found. Compared to aerial leaves, Genlisea traps displayed a transcriptional up-regulation of endogenous NADH oxidases generating reactive oxygen species as well as of acid phosphatases for prey digestion. A leaf-versus-trap transcriptome comparison reflects that carnivory provides inorganic P- and different forms of N-compounds (ammonium, nitrate, amino acid, oligopeptides) and implies the need to protect trap cells against oxidative stress. The analysis elucidates a complex food web inside the Genlisea traps, and suggests ecological relationships between this plant genus and its entrapped microbiome.},

abstract = {Fermentation-based metabolism is an important ecosystem function often associated with environments rich in organic carbon, such as wetlands, sewage sludge and the mammalian gut. The diversity of microorganisms and pathways involved in carbon and hydrogen cycling in sediments and aquifers and the impacts of these processes on other biogeochemical cycles remain poorly understood. Here we used metagenomics and proteomics to characterize microbial communities sampled from an aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River at Rifle, CO, USA, and document interlinked microbial roles in geochemical cycling. The organic carbon content in the aquifer was elevated via acetate amendment of the groundwater occurring over 2 successive years. Samples were collected at three time points, with the objective of extensive genome recovery to enable metabolic reconstruction of the community. Fermentative community members include organisms from a new phylum, Melainabacteria, most closely related to Cyanobacteria, phylogenetically novel members of the Chloroflexi and Bacteroidales, as well as candidate phyla genomes (OD1, BD1-5, SR1, WWE3, ACD58, TM6, PER and OP11). These organisms have the capacity to produce hydrogen, acetate, formate, ethanol, butyrate and lactate, activities supported by proteomic data. The diversity and expression of hydrogenases suggests the importance of hydrogen metabolism in the subsurface. Our proteogenomic data further indicate the consumption of fermentation intermediates by Proteobacteria can be coupled to nitrate, sulfate and iron reduction. Thus, fermentation carried out by previously unknown members of sediment microbial communities may be an important driver of nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur, carbon and iron cycling.},

abstract = {Nitrous oxide (N2O) is one of the three main biogenic greenhouse gases (GHGs) and agriculture represents close to 30 {\%} of the total N2O net emissions. In agricultural soils, N2O is emitted by two main microbial processes, nitrification and denitrification, both of which can convert synthetic nitrogen fertilizer into N2O. Legume-rhizobia symbiosis could be an effective and environmental-friendly alternative to nitrogen fertilization and hence, to mitigate soil N2O emissions. However, legume crops also contribute to N2O emissions. A better understanding of the environmental factors involved in the emission of N2O from nodules would be instrumental for mitigating the release of this GHG gas. In this work, in vivo N2O emissions from nodulated soybean roots in response to nitrate (0, 1, 2 and 4 mM) and flooding have been measured. To investigate the contribution of rhizobial denitrification in N2O emission from nodules, plants were inoculated with B. japonicum USDA110 and napA and nosZ denitrification mutants. The results showed that nitrate was essential for N2O emissions and its concentration enhanced N2O fluxes showing a statistical linear correlation, being the highest N2O fluxes obtained with 4 mM nitrate. When inoculated plants grown with 4 mM nitrate were subjected to flooding, a 150- and 830-fold induction of N2O emission rates from USDA110 and nosZ nodulated roots, respectively, was observed compared to non-flooded plants, especially during long-term flooding. Under these conditions, N2O emissions from detached nodules produced by the napA mutant were significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.05) than those produced by the wild-type strain (382 versus 1120 nmol N2O h−1 g−1 NFW, respectively). In contrast, nodules from plants inoculated with the nosZ mutant accumulated statistically higher levels of N2O compared to wild-type nodules (2522 versus nmol 1120 N2O h−1 g−1 NFW, p {\textless} 0.05). These results demonstrate that flooding is an important environmental factor for N2O emissions from soybean nodules and that B. japonicum denitrification is involved in such emission.},

abstract = {Many practicing biologists accept that nothing in their discipline makes sense except in the light of evolution, and that natural selection is evolution's principal sense-maker. But what natural selection actually is (a force or a statistical outcome, for example) and the levels of the biological hierarchy (genes, organisms, species, or even ecosystems) at which it operates directly are still actively disputed among philosophers and theoretical biologists. Most formulations of evolution by natural selection emphasize the differential reproduction of entities at one or the other of these levels. Some also recognize differential persistence, but in either case the focus is on lineages of material things: even species can be thought of as spatiotemporally restricted, if dispersed, physical beings. Few consider-as “units of selection” in their own right-the processes implemented by genes, cells, species, or communities. “It's the song not the singer” (ITSNTS) theory does that, also claiming that evolution by natural selection of processes is more easily understood and explained as differential persistence than as differential reproduction. ITSNTS was formulated as a response to the observation that the collective functions of microbial communities (the songs) are more stably conserved and ecologically relevant than are the taxa that implement them (the singers). It aims to serve as a useful corrective to claims that “holobionts” (microbes and their animal or plant hosts) are aggregate “units of selection,” claims that often conflate meanings of that latter term. But ITSNS also seems broadly applicable, for example, to the evolution of global biogeochemical cycles and the definition of ecosystem function.},

abstract = {The elucidation of structure-affinity relationships in EF-hand proteins requires a reliable assay of divalent ion affinity. In principle, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) should be capable of furnishing estimates for Ca2+- and Mg2+-binding constants in these systems. And because the method yields the binding enthalpy directly, ITC can provide a more detailed view of binding energetics than methods that rely on45Ca2+or fluorescent indicators. For several reasons, however, it is generally not possible to extract reliable binding parameters from single ITC experiments. Ca2+affinity is often too high, and Mg2+affinity is invariably too low. Moreover, least-squares minimization of multisite systems may not afford a unique fit because of strong parameter correlations. This chapter outlines a strategy for analyzing two-site systems that overcomes these obstacles. The method-which involves simultaneous, or global, least-squares analysis of direct and competitive ITC data-yields binding parameters for both Ca2+and Mg2+. Application of the method is demonstrated for two systems. The S55D/E59D variant of rat $\alpha$-parvalbumin, noteworthy for its elevated metal ion affinity, binds divalent ions noncooperatively and is amenable to analysis using an independent two-site model. On the other hand, Phl p 7, a pollen-specific EF-hand protein from timothy grass, binds Ca2+with positive cooperativity. Divalent ion-binding data for the protein must be analyzed using a two-site Adair model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Land plants associate with a root microbiota distinct from the complex microbial community present in surrounding soil. The microbiota colonizing the rhizosphere (immediately surrounding the root) and the endophytic compartment (within the root) contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration and phytoremediation. Colonization of the root occurs despite a sophisticated plant immune system, suggesting finely tuned discrimination of mutualists and commensals from pathogens. Genetic principles governing the derivation of host-specific endophyte communities from soil communities are poorly understood. Here we report the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene of more than 600 Arabidopsis thaliana plants to test the hypotheses that the root rhizosphere and endophytic compartment microbiota of plants grown under controlled conditions in natural soils are sufficiently dependent on the host to remain consistent across different soil types and developmental stages, and sufficiently dependent on host genotype to vary between inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We describe different bacterial communities in two geochemically distinct bulk soils and in rhizosphere and endophytic compartments prepared from roots grown in these soils. The communities in each compartment are strongly influenced by soil type. Endophytic compartments from both soils feature overlapping, low-complexity communities that are markedly enriched in Actinobacteria and specific families from other phyla, notably Proteobacteria. Some bacteria vary quantitatively between plants of different developmental stage and genotype. Our rigorous definition of an endophytic compartment microbiome should facilitate controlled dissection of plant-microbe interactions derived from complex soil communities.},

To advance Azolla domestication, we research its dissemination, storage and transcriptome. Methods for dissemination, cross-fertilization and cryopreservation of the symbiosis Azolla filiculoides-Nostoc azollae are tested based on the fern spores. To study molecular processes in Azolla including spore induction, a database of 37 649 unigenes from RNAseq of microsporocarps, megasporocarps and sporophytes was assembled, then validated. Spores obtained year-round germinated in vitro within 26 d. In vitro fertilization rates reached 25{\%}. Cryopreservation permitted storage for at least 7 months. The unigene database entirely covered central metabolism and to a large degree covered cellular processes and regulatory networks. Analysis of genes engaged in transition to sexual reproduction revealed a FLOWERING LOCUS T-like protein in ferns with special features induced in sporulating Azolla fronds.

abstract = {Management of nitrogen (N) inputs into agricultural systems is of increasing interest due to the intensive use of synthetic fertilizers in modern cash crop systems, which has caused considerable environmental damage, including nitrate contamination of surface and groundwater, eutrophication of coastal marine areas and emission of greenhouse gases. The use of legumes grown in rotations or intercropping is nowadays regarded as an alternative and sustainable way of introducing N into low-input cropping systems. In order to develop a simple tool to assess biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by legume pulse and forages within crop rotations, we conducted a systematic literature survey with a quantitative statistical analysis intended to define a robust relationship between measurable variables and N2 fixation. We found highly significant correlations between total N accumulation in shoot matter and fixed N2 in forage ( y = 0.79x - 0.49) and grain ( y = 0.70x + 1.01) legumes. Accurately estimating the contribution of belowground components is more difficult because of a lack of relevant studies. Properly assessing BNF is crucial to evaluate the possibility of diversified legume based cropping systems achieving a balance between inputs and outputs, thus ensuring both short-term productivity and long-term sustainability. For a typical nine-year organic rotation in the Paris basin alternating legumes and cereals, the soil surface balance, calculated with the relationships obtained, indicated that N fluxes were balanced, leaving a surplus of only a few kg N/ha/yr, with legumes accounting for 86{\%} of total N inputs.},

abstract = {Viruses infecting prokaryotic cells (phages) are the most abundant entities of the biosphere and contain a largely uncharted wealth of genomic diversity. They play a critical role in the biology of their hosts and in ecosystem functioning at large. The classical approaches studying phages require isolation from a pure culture of the host. Direct sequencing approaches have been hampered by the small amounts of phage DNA present in most natural habitats and the difficulty in applying meta-omic approaches, such as annotation of small reads and assembly. Serendipitously, it has been discovered that cellular metagenomes of highly productive ocean waters (the deep chlorophyll maximum) contain significant amounts of viral DNA derived from cells undergoing the lytic cycle. We have taken advantage of this phenomenon to retrieve metagenomic fosmids containing viral DNA from a Mediterranean deep chlorophyll maximum sample. This method allowed description of complete genomes of 208 new marine phages. The diversity of these genomes was remarkable, contributing 21 genomic groups of tailed bacteriophages of which 10 are completely new. Sequence based methods have allowed host assignment to many of them. These predicted hosts represent a wide variety of important marine prokaryotic microbes like members of SAR11 and SAR116 clades, Cyanobacteria and also the newly described low GC Actinobacteria. A metavirome constructed from the same habitat showed that many of the new phage genomes were abundantly represented.

abstract = {The nitrogen-fixing symbiosis between cyanobacteria and the water fern Azolla microphylla is, in contrast to other cyanobacteria-plant symbioses, the only one of a perpetual nature. The cyanobacterium is vertically transmitted between the plant generations, via vegetative fragmentation of the host or sexually within megasporocarps. In the latter process, subsets of the cyanobacterial population living endophytically in the Azolla leaves function as inocula for the new plant generations. Using electron microscopy and immunogold-labeling, the fate of the cyanobacterium during colonization and development of the megasporocarp was revealed. On entering the indusium chamber of the megasporocarps as small-celled motile cyanobacterial filaments (hormogonia), these differentiated into large thick-walled akinetes (spores) in a synchronized manner. This process was accompanied by cytoplasmic reorganizations and the release of numerous membrane vesicles, most of which contained DNA, and the formation of a highly structured biofilm. Taken together the data revealed complex adaptations in the cyanobacterium during its transition between plant generations.},

An extracellular inner envelope, which forms a boundary between the central cavity region and the peripheral region containing cyanobacteria and (or) bacteria, was found in all closed leaf cavities of symbiotic and Anabaena-free Azolla species. In the youngest leaf, which is in the process of developing a cavity, a continuous inner envelope was never observed. However, in young leaves that contained closed cavities, and in older leaves, continuous inner envelopes were always observed. The inner envelope may serve to restrict the symbionts to the cavity periphery. The inner envelope was similar in appearance to the outer envelope, which encloses the symbionts and hair cells within leaf cavities. Examination of the inner envelope using three different fixation procedures revealed that it was most distinct in fronds fixed in potassium permanganate, suggesting that it is membranelike in structure. The envelope was occasionally seen folded back upon itself or curled, which is also characteristic of a membranelike structure. Nevertheless, the envelope did not exhibit typical tripartite membrane ultrastructure. The occurrence of the inner envelope in Anabaena-free Azolla indicates that this envelope is of eubacterial or plant origin.},

abstract = {Since the colonization of land by ancestral plant lineages 450 million years ago, plants and their associated microbes have been interacting with each other, forming an assemblage of species that is often referred to as a "holobiont." Selective pressure acting on holobiont components has likely shaped plant-associated microbial communities and selected for host-adapted microorganisms that impact plant fitness. However, the high microbial densities detected on plant tissues, together with the fast generation time of microbes and their more ancient origin compared to their host, suggest that microbe-microbe interactions are also important selective forces sculpting complex microbial assemblages in the phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and plant endosphere compartments. Reductionist approaches conducted under laboratory conditions have been critical to decipher the strategies used by specific microbes to cooperate and compete within or outside plant tissues. Nonetheless, our understanding of these microbial interactions in shaping more complex plant-associated microbial communities, along with their relevance for host health in a more natural context, remains sparse. Using examples obtained from reductionist and community-level approaches, we discuss the fundamental role of microbe-microbe interactions (prokaryotes and micro-eukaryotes) for microbial community structure and plant health. We provide a conceptual framework illustrating that interactions among microbiota members are critical for the establishment and the maintenance of host-microbial homeostasis.},

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed major advances in our knowledge of plant mutualistic symbioses such as the rhizobium-legume symbiosis (RLS) and arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). Some of these findings caused the revision of longstanding hypotheses, but one of the most solid theories is that a conserved set of plant proteins rules the transduction of symbiotic signals from beneficial glomeromycetes and rhizobia in a so-called common symbiotic pathway (CSP). Nevertheless, the picture still misses several elements, and a few crucial points remain unclear. How does one common pathway discriminate between – at least – two symbionts? Can we exclude that microbes other than AM fungi and rhizobia also use this pathway to communicate with their host plants?We here discuss the possibility that our current view is biased by a long-lasting focus on legumes, whose ability to develop both AM and RLS is an exception among plants and a recent innovation in their evolution; investigations in non-legumes are starting to place legume symbiotic signaling in a broader perspective. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that CSP proteins act in a wider scenario of symbiotic and non-symbiotic signaling. Overall, evidence is accumulating in favor of distinct activities for CSP proteins in AM and RLS, depending on the molecular and cellular context where they act},

abstract = {3-Nitropropionic acid (3NPA) is a widespread nitroaliphatic toxin found in a variety of legumes and fungi. Several enzymes have been reported that can transform the compound, but none led to the mineralization of 3NPA. We report here the isolation of bacteria that grow on 3NPA and its anion, propionate-3-nitronate (P3N), as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Experiments with resting cells, cell extracts, and purified enzymes indicate that the pathway involves conversion of 3NPA to P3N, which upon denitration yields malonic semialdehyde, nitrate, nitrite, and traces of H 2O2. Malonic semialdehyde is decarboxylated to acetyl coenzyme A. The gene that encodes the enzyme responsible for the denitration of P3N was cloned and expressed, and the enzyme was purified. Stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that the enzyme is a monooxygenase. The gene sequence is related to a large group of genes annotated as 2-nitropropane dioxygenases, but the P3N monooxygenase and closely related enzymes form a cluster within COG2070 that differs from previously characterized 2-nitropropane dioxygenases by their substrate specificities and reaction products. The results suggest that the P3N monooxygenases enable bacteria to exploit 3NPA in natural habitats as a growth substrate. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

Different Arthrobacter species have been invariably isolated from the leaf cavities and sporocarps of several fern species.About the role of the bacteria in the association, it is probable that the bacteria affect the carbon and nitrogen metabolism of the cavity bycompeting with the Anabaena for the nutrients and in the meantime it is likely that their high respiratory activityfavours the establishment of a microaerobic environment and consequently the nitrogenase activity. Furthermore Arthrobacter may contribute to the production of the mucilage present in the algalpackets by excreting extracellular polysaccharides, which components can be involved in lectin binding with Azolla and Anabaena. Finally the IAA formation by Arthrobacter may influence the hormonal balance during the establishment of the association. {\textcopyright} 1993 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {The ontological changes in cyanobacterial ultrastructure, including akinete germination and heterocyst differentiation, during the propagation of mature sporophytes from Azolla microphylla sporocarps were examined using transmission electron microscopy. Rehydrated Azolla megasporocarps contained cyanobacterial akinetes having a multilayered envelope and large amounts of cyanophycin and glycogen. Concomitant with the initial stages of sporocarp germination was the formation of vegetative cyanobacterial cells via germination of akinetes. Once fem plantlets had four visible leaves, vegetative cyanobacterial cells had begun to differentiate into heterocysts in the cavity of the oldest leaf; this timing was very similar to that observed in vegetatively reproducing sporophytes. Ultrastructural characteristics of vegetative cyanobacterial cells present at the apical meristem of plants generated either by sporocarp germination or vegetative propagation were indistinguishable. These cells remained in an undifferentiated state regardless of plant age. However, as in vegetatively propagated plants, the cyanobacterial population and ultrastructural characteristics of cells in older leaf cavities were exceedingly diverse. This is the first report that groups of pleomorphic eubacteria are contained beneath the indusium of rehydrated Azolla microphylla megasporocarps. Concomitant with the early morphological changes of germination of Azolla megasporocarps and endosymbiotic akinetes was the initiation of cell division by the eubacteria.},

abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine the still not completely described microbiome associated with the aquatic fern Azolla filiculoides. During the experiment, 58 microbial isolates (43 epiphytes and 15 endophytes) with different morphologies were obtained. We successfully identified 85{\%} of microorganisms and assigned them to 9 bacterial genera: Achromobacter, Bacillus, Microbacterium, Delftia, Agrobacterium, and Alcaligenes (epiphytes) as well as Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Acinetobacter (endophytes). We also studied an A. filiculoides cyanobiont originally classified as Anabaena azollae; however, the analysis of its morphological traits suggests that this should be renamed as Trichormus azollae. Finally, the potential of the representatives of the identified microbial genera to synthesize plant growth-promoting substances such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), cellulase and protease enzymes, siderophores and phosphorus (P) and their potential of utilization thereof were checked. Delftia sp. AzoEpi7 was the only one from all the identified genera exhibiting the ability to synthesize all the studied growth promoters; thus, it was recommended as the most beneficial bacteria in the studied microbiome. The other three potentially advantageous isolates (Micrococcus sp. AzoEndo14, Agrobacterium sp. AzoEpi25 and Bacillus sp. AzoEndo3) displayed 5 parameters: IAA (excluding Bacillus sp. AzoEndo3), cellulase, protease, siderophores (excluding Micrococcus sp. AzoEndo14), as well as mineralization and solubilization of P (excluding Agrobacterium sp. AzoEpi25).},

Multicellular organisms can no longer be considered individuals by the classical definitions of the term. Every natural animal and plant is a holobiont consisting of the host and diverse symbiotic microbes and viruses. Microbial symbionts can be transmitted from parent to offspring by a variety of methods, including via cytoplasmic inheritance, coprophagy, direct contact during and after birth, and the environment. A large number of studies have demonstrated that these symbionts contribute to the anatomy, physiology, development, innate and adaptive immunity, and behavior and finally also to genetic variation and to the origin and evolution of species. Acquisition of microbes and microbial genes is a powerful mechanism for driving the evolution of complexity. Evolution proceeds both via cooperation and competition, working in parallel.},

abstract = {Sustainable agriculture demands reduced input of man-made nitrogen (N) fertilizer, yet N2 fixation limits the productivity of crops with heterotrophic diazotrophic bacterial symbionts. We investigated floating ferns from the genus Azolla that host phototrophic diazotrophic Nostoc azollae in leaf pockets and belong to the fastest growing plants. Experimental production reported here demonstrated N-fertilizer independent production of nitrogen-rich biomass with an annual yield potential per ha of 1200 kg-1 N fixed and 35 t dry biomass. 15N2 fixation peaked at noon, reaching 0.4 mg N g-1 dry weight h-1. Azolla ferns therefore merit consideration as protein crops in spite of the fact that little is known about the fern's physiology to enable domestication. To gain an understanding of their nitrogen physiology, analyses of fern diel transcript profiles under differing nitrogen fertilizer regimes were combined with microscopic observations. Results established that the ferns adapted to the phototrophic N2-fixing symbionts N. azollae by 1) adjusting metabolically to nightly absence of N supply using responses ancestral to ferns and seed plants; 2) developing a specialized xylem-rich vasculature surrounding the leaf pocket organ; 3) responding to N-supply by controlling transcripts of genes mediating nutrient transport, allocation and vasculature development. Unlike other non-seed plants, the Azolla fern clock is shown to contain both the morning and evening loops; the evening loop is known to control rhythmic gene expression in the vasculature of seed plants and therefore may have evolved along with the vasculature in the ancestor of ferns and seed plants.},

Fucose was the most abundant monosaccharide, both in treated and in untreated plants, suggesting its plant origin. The amount of glucose and galactose in erythromycin treated Azolla decreased, suggesting that these monosaccharides are produced both by Anabaena and by bacteria. Lectin binding was observed microscopically using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectins. Algal packet polysaccharides of untreated plants had glucose as hapten, which was also revealed on the surface of both Anabaena and bacteria.

abstract = {Awareness that our planet is a self-supporting biosphere with sunlight as its major source of energy for life has resulted in a long-term historical fascination with the workings of self-supporting ecological systems. However, the studies of such systems have never entered the canon of ecological or evolutionary tools and instead, have led a fringe existence connected to life support system engineering and space travel. We here introduce a framework for a renaissance in biospherics based on the study of matter-closed, energy-open ecosystems at a microbial level (microbial biospherics). Recent progress in genomics, robotics, and sensor technology makes the study of closed systems now much more tractable than in the past, and we argue that the time has come to emancipate the study of closed systems from this fringe context and bring them into a mainstream approach for studying ecosystem processes. By permitting highly replicated long-term studies, especially on predetermined and simplified systems, microbial biospheres offer the opportunity to test and develop strong hypotheses about ecosystem function and the ecological and evolutionary determinants of long-term system failure or persistence. Unlike many sciences, ecosystem ecology has never fully embraced a reductionist approach and has remained focused on the natural world in all its complexity. We argue that a reductionist approach to ecosystem ecology, using microbial biospheres, based on a combination of theory and the replicated study of much simpler self-enclosed microsystems could pay huge dividends.},

abstract = {3-Nitropropionate (3-NPA) is a nitro aliphatic compound found in numerous plants and fungi. The nitro compound exists in equilibrium with its conjugate base, propionate 3-nitronate (P3N) and has a pKa approaching the physiological range of 9.1. Since 1920, more than 30 species of plant and fungi have been identified as producing 3-NPA as a means of defense from herbivores. Glycoside products containing moieties of 3-NPA found in parts of the plants most accessible to herbivores can be easily hydrolyzed to free 3-NPA by bacterial enzymes in the gut of animals. In addition to providing a defense mechanism, the nitro compound is an intermediate in the nitrification process of leguminous plants. The synthesis of 3-NPA in these plants and fungi is poorly understood. P3N, which readily forms from 3-NPA at physiological pH, is a potent inhibitor of the key enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain. Inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase in humans and livestock causes neurotoxicity and in some cases death. Several enzymes catalyze the oxidation of 3-NPA or P3N; all contain a noncovalently bound flavin cofactor and are found in the organisms that produce 3-NPA. With k cat/Km values of {\textgreater}106 M-1 s -1, nitronate monooxygenases can quickly and efficiently oxidize P3N to malonic semialdehyde as a means of protecting the organism from killing itself. Although it was discovered almost a century ago, the biochemistry and physiological role of 3-NPA/P3N are just emerging. {\textcopyright} 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(9):759-768, 2013 {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.},

abstract = {Humans are currently confronted by many global challenges. These include achieving food security for a rapidly expanding population, lowering the risk of climate change by reducing the net release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere due to human activity, and meeting the increasing demand for energy in the face of dwindling reserves of fossil energy and uncertainties about future reliability of supply. Legumes deliver several important services to societies. They provide important sources of oil, fiber, and protein-rich food and feed while supplying nitrogen (N) to agro-ecosystems via their unique ability to fix atmospheric N2 in symbiosis with the soil bacteria rhizobia, increasing soil carbon content, and stimulating the productivity of the crops that follow. However, the role of legumes has rarely been considered in the context of their potential to contribute to the mitigation of climate change by reducing fossil fuel use or by providing feedstock for the emerging biobased economies where fossil sources of energy and industrial raw materials are replaced in part by sustainable and renewable biomass resources. The aim of this review was to collate the current knowledge regarding the capacity of legumes to (1) lower the emissions of the key greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) compared to N-fertilized systems, (2) reduce the fossil energy used in the production of food and forage, (3) contribute to the sequestration of carbon (C) in soils, and (4) provide a viable source of biomass for the generation of biofuels and other materials in future biorefinery concepts. We estimated that globally between 350 and 500 Tg CO2 could be emitted as a result of the 33 to 46 Tg N that is biologically fixed by agricultural legumes each year. This compares to around 300 Tg CO2 released annually from the manufacture of 100 Tg fertilizer N. The main difference is that the CO2 respired from the nodulated roots of N2-fixing legumes originated from photosynthesis and will not represent a net contribution to atmospheric concentrations of CO2, whereas the CO2 generated during the synthesis of N fertilizer was derived from fossil fuels. Experimental measures of total N2O fluxes from legumes and N-fertilized systems were found to vary enormously (0.03–7.09 and 0.09–18.16 kg N2O–N ha−1, respectively). This reflected the data being collated from a diverse range of studies using different rates of N inputs, as well as the large number of climatic, soil, and management variables known to influence denitrification and the portion of the total N lost as N2O. Averages across 71 site-years of data, soils under legumes emitted a total of 1.29 kg N2O–N ha−1 during a growing season. This compared to a mean of 3.22 kg N2O–N ha−1 from 67 site-years of N-fertilized crops and pastures, and 1.20 kg N2O–N ha−1 from 33 site-years of data collected from unplanted soils or unfertilized nonlegumes. It was concluded that there was little evidence that biological N2 fixation substantially contributed to total N2O emissions, and that losses of N2O from legume soil were generally lower than N-fertilized systems, especially when commercial rates of N fertilizer were applied. Elevated rates of N2O losses can occur following the termination of legume-based pastures, or where legumes had been green- or brown-manured and there was a rapid build-up of high concentrations of nitrate in soil. Legume crops and legume-based pastures use 35{\%} to 60{\%} less fossil energy than N-fertilized cereals or grasslands, and the inclusion of legumes in cropping sequences reduced the average annual energy usage over a rotation by 12{\%} to 34{\%}. The reduced energy use was primarily due to the removal of the need to apply N fertilizer and the subsequently lower N fertilizer requirements for crops grown following legumes. Life cycle energy balances of legume-based rotations were also assisted by a lower use of agrichemicals for crop protection as diversification of cropping sequences reduce the incidence of cereal pathogens and pests and assisted weed control, although it was noted that differences in fossil energy use between legumes and Nfertilized systems were greatly diminished if energy use was expressed per unit of biomass or grain produced. For a change in land use to result in a net increase C sequestration in soil, the inputs of C remaining in plant residues need to exceed the CO2 respired by soil microbes during the decomposition of plant residues or soil organic C, and the C lost through wind or water erosion. The net N-balance of the system was a key driver of changes in soil C stocks in many environments, and data collected from pasture, cropping, and agroforestry systems all indicated that legumes played a pivotal role in providing the additional organic N required to encourage the accumulation of soil C at rates greater than can be achieved by cereals or grasses even when they were supplied with N fertilizer. Legumes contain a range of compounds, which could be refined to produce raw industrial materials currently manufactured from petroleum-based sources, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, or food additives as valuable by-products if legume biomass was to be used to generate biodiesel, bioethanol, biojet A1 fuel, or biogas. The attraction of using leguminous material feedstock is that they do not need the inputs of N fertilizer that would otherwise be necessary to support the production of high grain yields or large amounts of plant biomass since it is the high fossil energy use in the synthesis, transport, and application of N fertilizers that often negates much of the net C benefits of many other bioenergy sources. The use of legume biomass for biorefineries needs careful thought as there will be significant trade-offs with the current role of legumes in contributing to the organic fertility of soils. Agricultural systems will require novel management and plant breeding solutions to provide the range of options that will be required to mitigate climate change. Given their array of ecosystem services and their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower the use of fossil energy, accelerate rates of C sequestration in soil, and provide a valuable source of feedstock for biorefineries, legumes should be considered as important components in the development of future agroecosystems.},

abstract = {Nitronate monooxygenase (NMO) oxidizes the mitochondrial toxin propionate 3-nitronate (P3N) to malonate semialdehyde. The enzyme has been previously characterized biochemically in fungi, but no structural information is available. Based on amino acid similarity 4,985 genes are annotated in the Gen- Bank™ as NMO. Of these, 4,424 (i.e. 89{\%}) are bacterial genes, including several Pseudomonads that have been shown to use P3N as growth substrate. Here, we have cloned and expressed the gene pa4202 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, purified the resulting protein, and characterized it. The enzyme is active on P3N and other alkyl nitronates, but cannot oxidize nitroalkanes. P3N is the best substrate at pH 7.5 and atmospheric oxygen with $\kappa$catapp/Κmapp of 12×106 M -1 s-1, $\kappa$catapp of 1300 s-1, and Κmapp of 110 $\mu$M. Anerobic reduction of the enzyme with P3N yields a flavosemiquinone, which is formed within 7.5 ms, consistent with this species being a catalytic intermediate. Absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography demonstrate a tightly, non-covalently bound FMN in the active site of the enzyme. Thus,PA4202is the first NMO identified and characterized in bacteria. The x-ray crystal structure of the enzyme was solved at 1.44 {\AA}, showing a TIM barrel-fold. Four motifs in common with the biochemically characterized NMO from Cyberlindnera saturnus are identified in the structure of bacterial NMO, defining Class I NMO, which includes bacterial, fungal, and two animal NMOs. Notably, the only otherNMOfrom Neurospora crassa for which biochemical evidence is available lacks the four motifs, defining Class IINMO. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

abstract = {Bourrat and Griffiths (Hist Philos Life Sci 40(2):33, 2018) have recently argued that most of the evidence presented by holobiont defenders to support the thesis that holobionts are evolutionary individuals is not to the point and is not even adequate to discriminate multispecies evolutionary individuals from other multispecies assemblages that would not be considered evolutionary individuals by most holobiont defenders. They further argue that an adequate criterion to distinguish the two categories is fitness alignment, presenting the notion of fitness boundedness as a criterion that allows divorcing true multispecies evolutionary individuals from other multispecies assemblages and provides an adequate criterion to single out genuine evolutionary multispecies assemblages. A consequence of their criterion is that holobionts, as conventionally defined by hologenome defenders, are not evolutionary individuals except in very rare cases, and for very specific host-symbiont associations. This paper is a critical response to Bourrat and Griffiths' arguments and a defence of the arguments presented by holobiont defenders. Drawing upon the case of the hologenomic basis of the evolution of sanguivory in vampire bats (Nat Ecol Evol 2:659–668, 2018), I argue that Bourrat and Griffiths overlook some aspects of the biological nature of the microbiome that justifies the thesis that holobionts are evolutionarily different to other multispecies assemblages. I argue that the hologenome theory of evolution should not define the hologenome as a collection of genomes, but as the sum of the host genome plus some traits of the microbiome which together constitute an evolutionary individual, a conception I refer to as the stability of traits conception of the hologenome. Based on that conception I argue that the evidence presented by holobiont defenders is to the point, and supports the thesis that holobionts are evolutionary individuals. In this sense, the paper offers an account of the holobiont that aims to foster a dialogue between hologenome advocates and hologenome critics.},

abstract = {Single-molecule sequencing instruments can generate multikilobase sequences with the potential to greatly improve genome and transcriptome assembly. However, the error rates of single-molecule reads are high, which has limited their use thus far to resequencing bacteria. To address this limitation, we introduce a correction algorithm and assembly strategy that uses short, high-fidelity sequences to correct the error in single-molecule sequences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a PacBio RS instrument from phage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic whole genomes, including the previously unsequenced genome of the parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, as well as for RNA-Seq reads of the corn (Zea mays) transcriptome. Our long-read correction achieves {\textgreater}99.9{\%} base-call accuracy, leading to substantially better assemblies than current sequencing strategies: in the best example, the median contig size was quintupled relative to high-coverage, second-generation assemblies. Greater gains are predicted if read lengths continue to increase, including the prospect of single-contig bacterial chromosome assembly.},

abstract = {The nutritional and physiological characteristics of 15 isolates from four species of the Azolla fern were determined. Although some minor variation existed in levels of urease activity, ability to utilize xylose, and formation of N 2 gas from NO 3 , all 15 isolates were rather similar and believed to represent a single species. These eubacteria exhibited aminopeptidase activity and became viscous when treated with KOH, similar to gram-negative organisms; however, the absence of lipopolysaccharide and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate in cell walls indicated that they are truly gram-positive organisms. They are unusual because peptidoglycan could not be detected during most of their growth cycle. The presence of lysine as the major diamino acid in cell wall hydrolysates, the inability to hydrolyze cellulose, and the distinctive developmental pattern with rods and “V” forms present during log phase, becoming progressively shorter until cocci dominated during stationary and death phases, indicated that these organisms belong to the genus Arthrobacter Conn and Dimmick. With the exception of the inability to hydrolyze gelatin, their characteristics are consistent with those of the type species, Arthrobacter globiformis Conn and Dimmick.},

abstract = {Microbial communities are vital in the functioning of all ecosystems; however, most microorganisms are uncultivated, and their roles in natural systems are unclear. Here, using random shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group II genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The Ferroplasma type II genome seems to be a composite from three ancestral strains that have undergone homologous recombination to form a large population of mosaic genomes. Analysis of the gene complement for each organism revealed the pathways for carbon and nitrogen fixation and energy generation, and provided insights into survival strategies in an extreme environment.},

abstract = {Understanding the biological stability of drinking water distribution systems is imperative in the framework of process control and risk management. The objective of this research was to examine the dynamics of the bacterial community during drinking water distribution at high temporal resolution. Water samples (156 in total) were collected over short time-scales (minutes/hours/days) from the outlet of a treatment plant and a location in its corresponding distribution network. The drinking water is treated by biofiltration and disinfectant residuals are absent during distribution. The community was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and flow cytometry as well as conventional, culture-based methods. Despite a random dramatic event (detected with pyrosequencing and flow cytometry but not with plate counts), the bacterial community profile at the two locations did not vary significantly over time. A diverse core microbiome was shared between the two locations (58-65{\%} of the taxa and 86-91{\%} of the sequences) and found to be dependent on the treatment strategy. The bacterial community structure changed during distribution, with greater richness detected in the network and phyla such as Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes becoming abundant. The rare taxa displayed the highest dynamicity, causing the major change during water distribution. This change did not have hygienic implications and is contingent on the sensitivity of the applied methods. The concept of biological stability therefore needs to be revised. Biostability is generally desired in drinking water guidelines but may be difficult to achieve in large-scale complex distribution systems that are inherently dynamic.},

abstract = {The symbiosis Azolla-Anabaena azollae, with a worldwide distribution in pantropical and temperate regions, is one of the most studied, because of its potential application as a biofertilizer, especially in rice fields, but also as an animal food and in phytoremediation. The cyanobiont is a filamentous, heterocystic cyanobacterium that inhabits the foliar cavities of the pteridophyte and the indusium on the megasporocarp (female reproductive structure). The classification and phylogeny of the cyanobiont is very controversial: from its morphology, it has been named Nostoc azollae, Anabaena azollae, Anabaena variabilis status azollae and recently Trichormus azollae, but, from its 16S rRNA gene sequence, it has been assigned to Nostoc and/or Anabaena, and from its phycocyanin gene sequence, it has been assigned as non-Nostoc and non-Anabaena. The literature also points to a possible co-evolution between the cyanobiont and the Azolla host, since dendrograms and phylogenetic trees of fatty acids, short tandemly repeated repetitive (STRR) analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of nif genes and the 16S rRNA gene give a two-cluster association that matches the two-section ranking of the host (Azolla). Another controversy surrounds the possible existence of more than one genus or more than one species strain. The use of freshly isolated or cultured cyanobionts is an additional problem, since their morphology and protein profiles are different. This review gives an overview of how morphological, chemical and genetic analyses influence the classification and phylogeny of the cyanobiont and future research.},

Here, we re-analyzed the sequencing data generated for the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini, and created a holistic display of the eukaryotic genome assembly using DNA data originating from two groups and eleven sequencing libraries. By using bacterial single-copy genes, k-mer frequencies, and coverage values of scaffolds we could identify and characterize multiple near-complete bacterial genomes from the raw assembly, and curate a 182 Mbp draft genome for H. dujardini supported by RNA-Seq data. Our results indicate that most contaminant scaffolds were assembled from Moleculo long-read libraries, and most of these contaminants have differed between library preparations. Our re-analysis shows that visualization and curation of eukaryotic genome assemblies can benefit from tools designed to address the needs of today's microbiologists, who are constantly challenged by the difficulties associated with the identification of distinct microbial genomes in complex environmental metagenomes.},

abstract = {How do we define the 'plant microbiome' and what is its significance to the plant genome? Before addressing what the microbiome is in relation to plants, it is important to first understand the concept of the microbiome; what this means in relation to the host becomes an extension of this working concept. Conceptualizing the microbiome requires a fusion of microbial ecology and bioinformatics, integrated with an understanding of both host biology and ecology. The analysis of microbiome structure and function was pioneered in studies of human hosts and has become widely recognized as essential to understanding genetic and functional capacity otherwise attributed to the host, including important aspects of metabolism and physiology. Plants are teeming with microbial organisms, including those that colonize internal tissues, in addition to those that adhere to external surfaces. Combined with the vast diversity of microorganisms in the soil rhizosphere, these plant-soil-associated microbes comprise the plant microbiome. The microbiome is intricately involved in plant health and serves as a reservoir of additional genes that plants can access when needed. Understanding the regulation of plant trait expression, hence plant performance and how this in turn impacts ecosystem function, requires that we study the impacts of the plant microbiome. Herein, the importance of the plant microbiome to plant genomics is addressed by defining the plant microbiome in relation to the ecology of the system with emphasis on habitats occurring belowground at the plant-soil interface, where focus is on the role of exudates as currency in this system. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of prokaryotic genome sequences becoming available is growing steadily and is growing faster than our ability to accurately annotate them. DESCRIPTION: We describe a fully automated service for annotating bacterial and archaeal genomes. The service identifies protein-encoding, rRNA and tRNA genes, assigns functions to the genes, predicts which subsystems are represented in the genome, uses this information to reconstruct the metabolic network and makes the output easily downloadable for the user. In addition, the annotated genome can be browsed in an environment that supports comparative analysis with the annotated genomes maintained in the SEED environment.The service normally makes the annotated genome available within 12-24 hours of submission, but ultimately the quality of such a service will be judged in terms of accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the produced annotations. We summarize our attempts to address these issues and discuss plans for incrementally enhancing the service. CONCLUSION: By providing accurate, rapid annotation freely to the community we have created an important community resource. The service has now been utilized by over 120 external users annotating over 350 distinct genomes.},

@article{Zilber-Rosenberg2008,
abstract = {We present here the hologenome theory of evolution, which considers the holobiont (the animal or plant with all of its associated microorganisms) as a unit of selection in evolution. The hologenome is defined as the sum of the genetic information of the host and its microbiota. The theory is based on four generalizations: (1) All animals and plants establish symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. (2) Symbiotic microorganisms are transmitted between generations. (3) The association between host and symbionts affects the fitness of the holobiont within its environment. (4) Variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in either the host or the microbiota genomes; under environmental stress, the symbiotic microbial community can change rapidly. These points taken together suggest that the genetic wealth of diverse microbial symbionts can play an important role both in adaptation and in evolution of higher organisms. During periods of rapid changes in the environment, the diverse microbial symbiont community can aid the holobiont in surviving, multiplying and buying the time necessary for the host genome to evolve. The distinguishing feature of the hologenome theory is that it considers all of the diverse microbiota associated with the animal or the plant as part of the evolving holobiont. Thus, the hologenome theory fits within the framework of the 'superorganism' proposed by Wilson and Sober.},

abstract = {Background: Saturated brines are extreme environments of low diversity. Salinibacter ruber is the only bacterium that inhabits this environment in significant numbers. In order to establish the extent of genetic diversity in natural populations of this microbe, the genomic sequence of reference strain DSM 13855 was compared to metagenomic fragments recovered from climax saltern crystallizers and obtained with 454 sequencing technology. This kind of analysis reveals the presence of metagenomic islands, i.e. highly variable regions among the different lineages in the population. Results: Three regions of the sequenced isolate were scarcely represented in the metagenome thus appearing to vary among co-occurring S. ruber cells. These metagenomic islands showed evidence of extensive genomic corruption with atypically low GC content, low coding density, high numbers of pseudogenes and short hypothetical proteins. A detailed analysis of island gene content showed that the genes in metagenomic island 1 code for cell surface polysaccharides. The strain-specific genes of metagenomic island 2 were found to be involved in biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharide components. Finally, metagenomic island 3 was rich in DNA related enzymes. Conclusion: The genomic organisation of S. ruber variable genomic regions showed a number of convergences with genomic islands of marine microbes studied, being largely involved in variable cell surface traits. This variation at the level of cell envelopes in an environment devoid of grazing pressure probably reflects a global strategy of bacteria to escape phage predation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Pa{\v{s}}i{\'{c}} et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

@article{Simonsen2014,
abstract = {Summary: A common empirical observation in mutualistic interactions is the persistence of variation in partner quality and, in particular, the persistence of exploitative phenotypes. For mutualisms between hosts and symbionts, most mutualism theory assumes that exploiters always impose fitness costs on their host. We exposed legume hosts to mutualistic (nitrogen-fixing) and exploitative (non-nitrogen-fixing) symbiotic rhizobia in field conditions, and manipulated the presence or absence of insect herbivory to determine if the costly fitness effects of exploitative rhizobia are context-dependent. Exploitative rhizobia predictably reduced host fitness when herbivores were excluded. However, insects caused greater damage on hosts associating with mutualistic rhizobia, as a consequence of feeding preferences related to leaf nitrogen content, resulting in the elimination of fitness costs imposed on hosts by exploitative rhizobia. Our experiment shows that herbivory is potentially an important factor in influencing the evolutionary dynamic between legumes and rhizobia. Partner choice and host sanctioning are theoretically predicted to stabilize mutualisms by reducing the frequency of exploitative symbionts. We argue that herbivore pressure may actually weaken selection on choice and sanction mechanisms, thus providing one explanation of why host-based discrimination mechanisms may not be completely effective in eliminating nonbeneficial partners. {\textcopyright} 2014 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {Bacteria of the genus Burkholderia establish an obligate symbiosis with plant species of the Rubiaceae and Primulaceae families. The bacteria, housed within the leaves, are transmitted hereditarily and have not yet been cultured. We have sequenced and compared the genomes of eight bacterial leaf nodule symbionts of the Rubiaceae plant family. All of the genomes exhibit features consistent with genome erosion. Genes potentially involved in the biosynthesis of kirkamide, an insecticidal C 7 N aminocyclitol, are conserved in most Rubiaceae symbionts. However, some have partially lost the kirkamide pathway due to genome erosion and are unable to synthesize the compound. Kirkamide synthesis is therefore not responsible for the obligate nature of the symbiosis. More importantly, we find evidence of intra-clade horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events affecting genes of the secondary metabolism. This indicates that substantial gene flow can occur at the early stages following host restriction in leaf nodule symbioses. We propose that host-switching events and plasmid conjugative transfers could have promoted these HGTs. This genomic analysis of leaf nodule symbionts gives, for the first time, new insights in the genome evolution of obligate symbionts in their early stages of the association with plants.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. Plants sense and respond to microbes utilizing a multilayered signalling cascade. In seed plants, the phytohormones jasmonic and salicylic acid (JA and SA) are key denominators of how plants respond to certain microbes. Their interplay is especially well-known for tipping the scales in plants' strategies of dealing with phytopathogens. In non-angiosperm lineages, the interplay is less well understood, but current data indicate that it is intertwined to a lesser extent and the canonical JA/SA antagonism appears to be absent. Here, we used the water fern Azolla filiculoides to gain insights into the fern's JA/SA signalling and the molecular communication with its unique nitrogen fixing cyanobiont Nostoc azollae, which the fern inherits both during sexual and vegetative reproduction. By mining large-scale sequencing data, we demonstrate that Azolla has most of the genetic repertoire to produce and sense JA and SA. Using qRT-PCR on the identified biosynthesis and signalling marker genes, we show that Azolla is responsive to exogenously applied SA. Furthermore, exogenous SA application influenced the abundance and gene expression of Azolla's cyanobiont. Our data provide a framework for JA/SA signalling in ferns and suggest that SA might be involved in Azolla's communication with its vertically inherited cyanobiont.},

Their mode of sexual reproduction is heterosporous. The regulation of the transition from the vegetative phase to the spore forming phase in ferns is largely unknown, yet a prerequisite for Azolla domestication, and of particular interest as ferns represent the sister lineage of seed plants. Sporocarps induced with far red light could be crossed so as to verify species attribution of strains from the Netherlands but not of the strain from the Anzali lagoon in Iran; the latter strain was assigned to a novel species cluster from South America. Red-dominated light suppresses the formation of dissemination stages in both gametophyte- and sporophyte-dominated lineages of plants, the response likely is a convergent ecological strategy to open fields. FR-responsive transcripts included those from MIKCC homologues of CMADS1 and miR319-controlled GAMYB transcription factors in the fern, transporters in N. azollae, and ycf2 in chloroplasts. Loci of conserved microRNA (miRNA) in the fern lineage included miR172, yet FR only induced miR529 and miR535, and reduced miR319 and miR159. Phylogenomic analyses of MIKCC TFs suggested that the control of flowering and flower organ specification may have originated from the diploid to haploid phase transition in the homosporous common ancestor of ferns and seed plants.},

abstract = {Regulation of the synthesis and activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain 7120 was studied by determining GS transferase activity and GS antigen concentration under a variety of conditions. Extracts prepared from cells growing exponentially on a medium supplemented with combined nitrogen had a GS activity of 17 mumol of gamma-glutamyl transferase activity per min per mg of protein at 37 degrees C. This activity doubled in 12 h after transfer of cells to a nitrogen-free medium, corresponding to the time required for heterocyst differentiation and the start of nitrogen fixation. Addition of NH3 to a culture 11 h after an inducing transfer immediately blocked the increase in GS activity. In the Enterobacteriaceae, addition of NH3 after induction results in the covalent modification of GS by adenylylation. The GS of Anabaena is not adenylylated by such a protocol, as shown by the resistance of the transferase activity of the enzyme to inhibition by Mg2+ and by the failure of the enzyme to incorporate 32P after NH3 upshift. Methionine sulfoximine inhibited Anabaena GS activity rapidly and irreversibly in vivo. After the addition of methionine sulfoximine to Anabaena, the level of GS antigen neither increased nor decreased, indicating that Glutamine cannot be the only small molecule capable of regulating GS synthesis. Methionine sulfoximine permitted heterocyst differentiation and nitrogenase induction to escape repression by NH3. Nitrogen-fixing cultures treated with methionine sulfoximine excreted NH3. The fern Azolla caroliniana contains an Anabaena species living in symbiotic association. The Anabaena species carries out nitrogen fixation sufficient to satisfy all of the combined nitrogen requirements of the host fern. Experiments by other workers have shown that the activity of GS in the symbiont is significantly lower than the activity of GS in free-living Anabaena. Using a sensitive radioimmune assay and a normalization procedure based on the content of diaminopimelic acid, a component unique to the symbiont, we found that the level of GS antigen in the symbiont was about 5{\%} of the level in free-living Anabaena cells. Thus, the host fern appears to repress synthesis of Anabaena GS in the symbiotic association.},

abstract = {Despite the large interest in the human microbiome in recent years, there are no reports of bacterial DNA methylation in the microbiome. Here metagenomic sequencing using the Pacific Biosciences platform allowed for rapid identification of bacterial GATC methylation status of a bacterial species in human stool samples. For this work, two stool samples were chosen that were dominated by a single species, Bacteroides dorei. Based on 16S rRNA analysis, this species represented over 45{\%} of the bacteria present in these two samples. The B. dorei genome sequence from these samples was determined and the GATC methylation sites mapped. The Bacteroides dorei genome from one subject lacked any GATC methylation and lacked the DNA adenine methyltransferase genes. In contrast, B. dorei from another subject contained 20,551 methylated GATC sites. Of the 4970 open reading frames identified in the GATC methylated B. dorei genome, 3184 genes were methylated as well as 1735 GATC methylations in intergenic regions. These results suggest that DNA methylation patterns are important to consider in multi-omic analyses of microbiome samples seeking to discover the diversity of bacterial functions and may differ between disease states.},

Brown. Rabbit anti-dinitrogenase reductase antisera and goat anti-rabbit-immunoglobulin G antibody conjugated to colloidal gold were used as probes. Western blot analyses showed that a polypeptide of approx. 36 kDa (kdalton) was recognized in the symbionts of all three Azolla species and that the polyclonal sera used were monospecific. In all symbionts, nitrogenase was immunologically recognizable within heterocysts. It was absent from vegetative cells, and also from the akinetes of the A. caroliniana and A. pinnata symbionts. The differentiation of vegetative cells into heterocysts in all three symbionts was initiated by formation of additional external cell-wall layers and narrowing of the neck followed by loss of glycogen, mild vesiculation of thylakoid membranes, and the appearance of polar nodules. No nitrogenase was detected at these early stages, but it appeared in the intermediate proheterocyst stage concomitantly with the formation of contorted membranes, and reached the strongest labeling in mature heterocysts, containing extensive tightly packed membranes. Nitrogenase was evenly distributed throughout heterocysts except at the polar regions, which contained honey-comb configurations and large polar nodules. With increased age of the A. caroliniana and A. pinnata symbionts, heterocysts became highly vesiculated, with a concomitant decrease in the amount of nitrogenase detected. {\textcopyright} 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {Heterosporous water ferns (Marsileaceae and Salviniaceae) are the only extant group of plants to have evolved heterospory since the Paleozoic. These ferns possess unusual reproductive structures traditionally termed "sporocarps." Using an evolutionary framework, we critically examine the complex homology issues pertaining to these structures. Comparative morphological study reveals that all heterosporous ferns bear indusiate sori on a branched, nonlaminate structure that we refer to as the sorophore; this expanded definition highlights homology previously obscured by the use of different terms. By using a homology-based concept, we aim to discontinue the use of historically and functionally based morphological terminology. We recognize the sorophore envelope as a structure that surrounds the sorophore and sori. The sorophore envelope is present in Marsileaceae as a sclerenchymatous sporocarp wall and in Azolla as a parenchymatous layer, but it is absent in Salvinia. Both homology assessments and phylogenetic character-state reconstructions using the Cretaceous fossil Hydropteris are consistent with a single origin of the sorophore envelope in heterosporous ferns. Consequently, we restrict the term "sporocarp" to a sorophore envelope and all it contains. Traditional usage of "sporocarp" is misleading because it implies homology for nonhomologous structures, and structures historically called sporocarps in Salviniaceae are more appropriately referred to as sori. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The University of Chicago.

@article{Lutz2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have revolutionized the field of genomics by drastically reducing the cost of sequencing, making it feasible for individual labs to sequence or resequence plant genomes. Obtaining high quality, high molecular weight DNA from plants poses significant challenges due to the high copy number of chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA, as well as high levels of phenolic compounds and polysaccharides. Multiple methods have been used to isolate DNA from plants; the CTAB method is commonly used to isolate total cellular DNA from plants that contain nuclear DNA, as well as chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA. Alternatively, DNA can be isolated from nuclei to minimize chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA contamination.

RESULTS: We describe optimized protocols for isolation of nuclear DNA from eight different plant species encompassing both monocot and eudicot species. These protocols use nuclei isolation to minimize chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA contamination. We also developed a protocol to determine the number of chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA copies relative to the nuclear DNA using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). We compared DNA isolated from nuclei to total cellular DNA isolated with the CTAB method. As expected, DNA isolated from nuclei consistently yielded nuclear DNA with fewer chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA copies, as compared to the total cellular DNA prepared with the CTAB method. This protocol will allow for analysis of the quality and quantity of nuclear DNA before starting a plant whole genome sequencing or resequencing experiment.

CONCLUSIONS: Extracting high quality, high molecular weight nuclear DNA in plants has the potential to be a bottleneck in the era of whole genome sequencing and resequencing. The methods that are described here provide a framework for researchers to extract and quantify nuclear DNA in multiple types of plants.},

abstract = {Roots are the primary site of interaction between plants and microorganisms. To meet food demands in changing climates, improved yields and stress resistance are increasingly important, stimulating efforts to identify factors that affect plant productivity. The role of bacterial endophytes that reside inside plants remains largely unexplored, because analysis of their specific functions is impeded by difficulties in cultivating most prokaryotes. Here, we present the first metagenomic approach to analyze an endophytic bacterial community resident inside roots of rice, one of the most important staple foods. Metagenome sequences were obtained from endophyte cells extracted from roots of field-grown plants. Putative functions were deduced from protein domains or similarity analyses of protein-encoding gene fragments, and allowed insights into the capacities of endophyte cells. This allowed us to predict traits and metabolic processes important for the endophytic lifestyle, suggesting that the endorhizosphere is an exclusive microhabitat requiring numerous adaptations. Prominent features included flagella, plant-polymer- degrading enzymes, protein secretion systems, iron acquisition and storage, quorum sensing, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Surprisingly, endophytes might be involved in the entire nitrogen cycle, as protein domains involved in N2-fixation, denitrification, and nitrification were detected and selected genes expressed. Our data suggest a high potential of the endophyte community for plant-growth promotion, improvement of plant stress resistance, biocontrol against pathogens, and bioremediation, regardless of their culturability.},

abstract = {Background: Insertion sequences (ISs) are approximately 1 kbp long "jumping" genes found in prokaryotes. ISs encode the protein Transposase, which facilitates the excision and reinsertion of ISs in genomes, making these sequences a type of class I ("cut-and-paste") Mobile Genetic Elements. ISs are proposed to be involved in the reductive evolution of symbiotic prokaryotes. Our previous sequencing of the genome of the cyanobacterium 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, living in a tight perpetual symbiotic association with a plant (the water fern Azolla), revealed the presence of an eroding genome, with a high number of insertion sequences (ISs) together with an unprecedented large proportion of pseudogenes. To investigate the role of ISs in the reductive evolution of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, and potentially in the formation of pseudogenes, a bioinformatic investigation of the IS identities and positions in 47 cyanobacterial genomes was conducted. To widen the scope, the IS contents were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively in 20 other genomes representing both free-living and symbiotic bacteria. Results: Insertion Sequences were not randomly distributed in the bacterial genomes and were found to transpose short distances from their original location ("local hopping") and pseudogenes were enriched in the vicinity of IS elements. In general, symbiotic organisms showed higher densities of IS elements and pseudogenes than non-symbiotic bacteria. A total of 1108 distinct repeated sequences over 500 bp were identified in the 67 genomes investigated. In the genome of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, IS elements were apparent at 970 locations (14.3{\%}), with 428 being full-length. Morphologically complex cyanobacteria with large genomes showed higher frequencies of IS elements, irrespective of life style. Conclusions: The apparent co-location of IS elements and pseudogenes found in prokaryotic genomes implies earlier IS transpositions into genes. As transpositions tend to be local rather than genome wide this likely explains the proximity between IS elements and pseudogenes. These findings suggest that ISs facilitate the reductive evolution in for instance in the symbiotic cyanobacterium 'Nostoc azollae' 0708 and in other obligate prokaryotic symbionts.},

The program uses hidden Markov models trained on data from the 5S ribosomal RNA database and the European ribosomal RNA database project. A pre-screening step makes the method fast with little loss of sensitivity, enabling the analysis of a complete bacterial genome in less than a minute. Results from running RNAmmer on a large set of genomes indicate that the location of rRNAs can be predicted with a very high level of accuracy. Novel, unannotated rRNAs are also predicted in many genomes. The software as well as the genome analysis results are available at the CBS web server.},

abstract = {Dinitrogen fixation by Nostoc azollae residing in specialized leaf pockets supports prolific growth of the floating fern Azolla filiculoides. To evaluate contributions by further microorganisms, the A. filiculoides microbiome and nitrogen metabolism in bacteria persistently associated with Azolla ferns were characterized. A metagenomic approach was taken complemented by detection of N2O released and nitrogen isotope determinations of fern biomass. Ribosomal RNA genes in sequenced DNA of natural ferns, their enriched leaf pockets and water filtrate from the surrounding ditch established that bacteria of A. filiculoides differed entirely from surrounding water and revealed species of the order Rhizobiales. Analyses of seven cultivated Azolla species confirmed persistent association with Rhizobiales. Two distinct nearly full-length Rhizobiales genomes were identified in leaf-pocket-enriched samples from ditch grown A. filiculoides. Their annotation revealed genes for denitrification but not N2-fixation. 15N2 incorporation was active in ferns with N. azollae but not in ferns without. N2O was not detectably released from surface-sterilized ferns with the Rhizobiales. N2-fixing N. azollae, we conclude, dominated the microbiome of Azolla ferns. The persistent but less abundant heterotrophic Rhizobiales bacteria possibly contributed to lowering O2 levels in leaf pockets but did not release detectable amounts of the strong greenhouse gas N2O.},

abstract = {In 2004, the SEED (http://pubseed.theseed.org/) was created to provide consistent and accurate genome annotations across thousands of genomes and as a platform for discovering and developing de novo annotations. The SEED is a constantly updated integration of genomic data with a genome database, web front end, API and server scripts. It is used by many scientists for predicting gene functions and discovering new pathways. In addition to being a powerful database for bioinformatics research, the SEED also houses subsystems (collections of functionally related protein families) and their derived FIGfams (protein families), which represent the core of the RAST annotation engine (http://rast.nmpdr.org/). When a new genome is submitted to RAST, genes are called and their annotations are made by comparison to the FIGfam collection. If the genome is made public, it is then housed within the SEED and its proteins populate the FIGfam collection. This annotation cycle has proven to be a robust and scalable solution to the problem of annotating the exponentially increasing number of genomes. To date, {\textgreater}12 000 users worldwide have annotated {\textgreater}60 000 distinct genomes using RAST. Here we describe the interconnectedness of the SEED database and RAST, the RAST annotation pipeline and updates to both resources.},

abstract = {DNA-based taxonomic and functional profiling is widely used for the characterization of organismal communities across a rapidly increasing array of research areas that include the role of microbiomes in health and disease, biomonitoring, and estimation of both microbial and metazoan species richness. Two principal approaches are currently used to assign taxonomy to DNA sequences: DNA metabarcoding and metagenomics. When initially developed, each of these approaches mandated their own particular methods for data analysis; however, with the development of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques they have begun to share many aspects in data set generation and processing. In this review we aim to define the current characteristics, goals and boundaries of each field, and describe the different software used for their analysis. We argue that an appreciation of the potential and limitations of each method can help underscore the improvements required by each field so as to better exploit the richness of current HTS-based data sets.},

abstract = {The objective of this case study was to obtain some first-hand information about the functional consequences of a cosmetic tongue split operation for speech and tongue motility. One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

Bacteria were observed in all leaf cavities of Azolla cultures. Five ultrastructurally distinct types of bacteria were observed in each individual leaf cavity. Features used to characterize the bacteria included morphology, cell wall structure, and cytoplasmic organization. At least one gram-positive and as many as four gram-negative types of bacteria reside in leaf cavities of A. caroliniana. The morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of the gram-positive bacterium suggest that it is an Arthrobacter sp. The gram-negative bacteria could not be cultured; therefore, they have not been classified further. Bacteria cell shape and cell wall structure were similar in leaf cavities of different ages, but cell size and cytoplasmic composition varied. The relative contributions of each bacterial type to the total community within individual leaves was determined. Ultrastructural characteristics of bacterial isolates cultured from A. caroliniana in a free-living state were also examined.},

abstract = {Various plant species establish intimate symbioses with bacteria within their aerial organs. The bacteria are contained within nodules or glands often present in distinctive patterns on the leaves in what is commonly referred to as leaf nodule symbiosis. We describe here a highly specific symbiosis between a wild yam species from Madagascar, Dioscorea sansibarensis and bacteria of the species Orrella dioscoreae. Using whole-genome sequencing of plastids and bacteria from wild-collected samples, we show phylogenetic patterns consistent with a dominant vertical mode of transmission of the symbionts. Unique so far among leaf nodule symbioses, the bacteria can be cultured and are amenable to comparative transcriptomics, revealing a potential role in complementing the host's arsenal of secondary metabolites. We propose a recent establishment of a vertical mode of transmission in this symbiosis which, together with a large effective population size explains the cultivability and apparent lack of genome reductive evolution in O. dioscoreae. We leverage these unique features to reveal pathways and functions under positive selection in these specialized endophytes, highlighting the candidate mechanisms enabling a permanent association in the phyllosphere.},

A few genes that determine symbiosis or resistance to infectious disease have been identified in model species, but a comprehensive examination of how a host genotype influences the structure of its microbial community is lacking. Here we report the results of a field experiment with the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana to identify the fungi and bacteria that colonize its leaves and the host loci that influence the microbe numbers. The composition of this community differs among accessions of A. thaliana. Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) suggest that plant loci responsible for defense and cell wall integrity affect variation in this community. Furthermore, species richness in the bacterial community is shaped by host genetic variation, notably at loci that also influence the reproduction of viruses, trichome branching and morphogenesis.},
