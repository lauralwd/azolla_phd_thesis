abstract = {IPython has provided terminal-based tools for interactive computing in Python since 2001. The notebook document format and multi-process architecture introduced in 2011 have expanded the applicable scope of IPython into teaching, presenting, and sharing computational work, in addition to interactive exploration. The new architecture also allows users to work in any language, with implementations in Python, R, Julia, Haskell, and several other languages. The language agnostic parts of IPython have been renamed to Jupyter, to better capture the notion that a cross-language design can encapsulate commonalities present in computational research regardless of the programming language being used. This architecture offers components like the web-based Notebook interface, that supports rich documents that combine code and computational results with text narratives, mathematics, images, video and any media that a modern browser can display. This interface can be used not only in research, but also for publication and education, as notebooks can be converted to a variety of output formats, including HTML and PDF. Recent developments in the Jupyter project include a multi-user environment for hosting notebooks for a class or research group, a live collaboration notebook via Google Docs, and better support for languages other than Python.},

abstract = {Recovery of ribosomal small subunit genes by assembly of short read community DNA sequence data generally fails, making taxonomic characterization difficult. Here, we solve this problem with a novel iterative method, based on the expectation maximization algorithm, that reconstructs full-length small subunit gene sequences and provides estimates of relative taxon abundances. We apply the method to natural and simulated microbial communities, and correctly recover community structure from known and previously unreported rRNA gene sequences. An implementation of the method is freely available at https://github.com/csmiller/EMIRGE.},

Three independent external data sources essentially agree with and support the assembly's sequence and ordering of contigs across the euchromatic portion of the genome. In addition, there are isolated contigs that we believe represent nonrepetitive pockets within the heterochromatin of the centromeres. Comparison with a previously sequenced 2.9-megabase region indicates that sequencing accuracy within nonrepetitive segments is greater than 99.99{\%} without manual curation.

@article{Millar2019,
abstract = {MicroR159 (miR159) is ancient, being present in the majority of land plants where it targets a class of regulatory genes called GAMYB or GAMYB-like via highly conserved miR159-binding sites. These GAMYB genes encode R2R3 MYB domain transcription factors that transduce the gibberellin (GA) signal in the seed aleurone and the anther tapetum. Here, GAMYB plays a conserved role in promoting the programmed cell death of these tissues, where miR159 function appears weak. By contrast, GAMYB is not involved in GA-signaling in vegetative tissues, but rather its expression is deleterious, leading to the inhibition of growth and development. Here, the major function of miR159 is to mediate strong silencing of GAMYB to enable normal growth. Highlighting this requirement of strong silencing are conserved RNA secondary structures associated with the miR159-binding site in GAMYB mRNA that promotes miR159-mediated repression. Although the miR159-GAMYB pathway in vegetative tissues has been implicated in a number of different functions, presently no conserved role for this pathway has emerged. We will review the current knowledge of the different proposed functions of miR159, and how this ancient pathway has been used as a model to help form our understanding of miRNA biology in plants.},

abstract = {Knowing phylogenetic relationships among species is fundamental for many studies in biology. An accurate phylogenetic tree underpins our understanding of the major transitions in evolution, such as the emergence of new body plans or metabolism, and is key to inferring the origin of new genes, detecting molecular adaptation, understanding morphological character evolution and reconstructing demographic changes in recently diverged species. Although data are ever more plentiful and powerful analysis methods are available, there remain many challenges to reliable tree building. Here, we discuss the major steps of phylogenetic analysis, including identification of orthologous genes or proteins, multiple sequence alignment, and choice of substitution models and inference methodologies. Understanding the different sources of errors and the strategies to mitigate them is essential for assembling an accurate tree of life.},

@article{Quammen,
abstract = {Our understanding of the ‘tree of life', with powerful implications for human genetics, human health and our own human nature, has recently completely changed. This book is about a new method of telling the story of life on earth – through molecular phylogenetics. It involves a fairly simple method – the reading of the deep history of life by looking at the variation in protein molecules found in living organisms. For instance, we now know that roughly eight per cent of the human genome arrived not through traditional inheritance from directly ancestral forms, but sideways by viral infection. In The Tangled Tree, acclaimed science writer David Quammen chronicles these discoveries through the lives of the researchers who made them – such as Carl Woese, the most important little-known biologist of the twentieth century; Lynn Margulis, the notorious maverick whose wild ideas about ‘mosaic' creatures proved to be true; and Tsutomu Wantanabe, who discovered that the scourge of antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a direct result of horizontal gene transfer, bringing the deep study of genome histories to bear on a global crisis in public health. Quammen explains how molecular studies of evolution have brought startling recognitions about the tangled tree of life – including where we humans fit into it. Thanks to new technologies, we now have the ability to alter even our genetic composition – through sideways insertions, as nature has long been doing. The Tangled Tree is a brilliant exploration of our transformed understanding of evolution and of life's history itself.},

abstract = {Due to its phenomenal growth requiring neither nitrogen fertilizer nor arable land and its biomass composition, the mosquito fern Azolla is a candidate crop to yield food, fuels and chemicals sustainably. To advance Azolla domestication, we research its dissemination, storage and transcriptome. Methods for dissemination, cross-fertilization and cryopreservation of the symbiosis Azolla filiculoides-Nostoc azollae are tested based on the fern spores. To study molecular processes in Azolla including spore induction, a database of 37 649 unigenes from RNAseq of microsporocarps, megasporocarps and sporophytes was assembled, then validated. Spores obtained year-round germinated in vitro within 26 d. In vitro fertilization rates reached 25{\%}. Cryopreservation permitted storage for at least 7 months. The unigene database entirely covered central metabolism and to a large degree covered cellular processes and regulatory networks. Analysis of genes engaged in transition to sexual reproduction revealed a FLOWERING LOCUS T-like protein in ferns with special features induced in sporulating Azolla fronds. Although domestication of a fern-cyanobacteria symbiosis may seem a daunting task, we conclude that the time is ripe and that results generated will serve to more widely access biochemicals in fern biomass for a biobased economy.},

abstract = {Present review addresses the advances made in the understanding of biogenesis of plant small RNAs and their role in plant development. We discuss the elaborate role of microRNAs (miRNAs) and trans-acting small interfering RNAs (ta-siRNAs) in various aspects of plant growth and development and highlight relevance of small RNA mobility. Small non-coding RNAs regulate various aspects of plant development. Small RNAs (sRNAs) of 21–24 nucleotide length are derived from double-stranded RNAs through the combined activity of several biogenesis and processing components. These sRNAs function by negatively regulating the expression of target genes. miRNAs and ta-siRNAs constitute two important classes of endogenous small RNAs in plants, which play important roles in plant growth and developmental processes like embryogenesis, organ formation and patterning, shoot and root growth, and reproductive development. Biogenesis of miRNAs is a multistep process which includes transcription, processing and modification, and their loading onto RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC). RISC-loaded miRNAs carry out post-transcriptional silencing of their target(s). Recent studies identified orthologues of different biogenesis components of novel and conserved small RNAs from different model plants. Although many small RNAs have been identified from diverse plant species, only a handful of them have been functionally characterized. In this review, we discuss the advances made in understanding the biogenesis, functional conservation/divergence in miRNA-mediated gene regulation, and the developmental role of small RNAs in different plant species.},

abstract = {Genome sequences from over 200 plant species have already been published, with this number expected to increase rapidly due to advances in sequencing technologies. Once a new genome has been assembled and the genes identified, the functional annotation of their putative translational products, proteins, using ontologies is of key importance as it places the sequencing data in a biological context. Furthermore, to keep pace with rapid production of genome sequences, this functional annotation process must be fully automated. Here we present a redesigned and significantly enhanced MapMan4 framework, together with a revised version of the associated online Mercator annotation tool. Compared with the original MapMan, the new ontology has been expanded almost threefold and enforces stricter assignment rules. This framework was then incorporated into Mercator4, which has been upgraded to reflect current knowledge across the land plant group, providing protein annotations for all embryophytes with a comparably high quality. The annotation process has been optimized to allow a plant genome to be annotated in a matter of minutes. The output results continue to be compatible with the established MapMan desktop application. MapMan4 is a substantial redesign of the MapMan framework incorporating the latest literature knowledge to provide greatly enhanced protein family granularity. The online Mercator4 tool uses this framework to rapidly functionally annotate protein sequences from any land plant species.},

abstract = {Despite the extraordinary significance leaves have for life on Earth, their origin and development remain vigorously debated. More than a century of paleobotanical, morphological, and phylogenetic research has still not resolved fundamental questions about leaves. Developmental genetic data are sparse in ferns, and comparative studies of lycophytes and seed plants have reached opposing conclusions on the conservation of a leaf developmental program. We performed phylogenetic and expression analyses of a leaf developmental regulator (Class III HD-Zip genes; C3HDZs) spanning lycophytes and ferns. We show that a duplication and neofunctionalization of C3HDZs probably occurred in the ancestor of euphyllophytes, and that there is a common leaf developmental mechanism conserved between ferns and seed plants. We show C3HDZ expression in lycophyte and fern sporangia and show that C3HDZs have conserved expression patterns during initiation of lateral primordia (leaves or sporangia). This expression is maintained throughout sporangium development in lycophytes and ferns and indicates an ancestral role of C3HDZs in sporangium development. We hypothesize that there is a deep homology of all leaves and that a sporangium-specific developmental program was coopted independently for the development of lycophyte and euphyllophyte leaves. This provides molecular genetic support for a paradigm shift in theories of lycophyte leaf evolution.},

abstract = {Since the colonization of land by ancestral plant lineages 450 million years ago, plants and their associated microbes have been interacting with each other, forming an assemblage of species that is often referred to as a "holobiont." Selective pressure acting on holobiont components has likely shaped plant-associated microbial communities and selected for host-adapted microorganisms that impact plant fitness. However, the high microbial densities detected on plant tissues, together with the fast generation time of microbes and their more ancient origin compared to their host, suggest that microbe-microbe interactions are also important selective forces sculpting complex microbial assemblages in the phyllosphere, rhizosphere, and plant endosphere compartments. Reductionist approaches conducted under laboratory conditions have been critical to decipher the strategies used by specific microbes to cooperate and compete within or outside plant tissues. Nonetheless, our understanding of these microbial interactions in shaping more complex plant-associated microbial communities, along with their relevance for host health in a more natural context, remains sparse. Using examples obtained from reductionist and community-level approaches, we discuss the fundamental role of microbe-microbe interactions (prokaryotes and micro-eukaryotes) for microbial community structure and plant health. We provide a conceptual framework illustrating that interactions among microbiota members are critical for the establishment and the maintenance of host-microbial homeostasis.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cyanobacteria associated with mosses represent a main nitrogen (N) source in pristine, high-latitude and -altitude ecosystems due to their ability to fix N2. However, despite progress made regarding moss-cyanobacteria associations, the factors driving the large interspecific variation in N2 fixation activity between moss species remain elusive. The aim of the study was to identify the traits of mosses that determine cyanobacterial colonization and thus N2 fixation activity. METHODS: Four moss species varying in N2 fixation activity were used to assess cyanobacterial abundance and activity to correlate it with moss traits (morphological, chemical, water-balance traits) for each species. KEY RESULTS: Moss hydration rate was one of the pivotal traits, explaining 56 and 38 {\%} of the variation in N2 fixation and cyanobacterial colonization, respectively, and was linked to morphological traits of the moss species. Higher abundance of cyanobacteria was found on shoots with smaller leaves, and with a high frequency of leaves. High phenol concentration inhibited N2 fixation but not colonization. These traits driving interspecific variation in cyanobacterial colonization, however, are also affected by the environment, and lead to intraspecific variation. Approximately 24 {\%} of paraphyllia, filamentous appendages on Hylocomium splendens stems, were colonized by cyanobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that interspecific variations in moss traits drive differences in cyanobacterial colonization and thus, N2 fixation activity among moss species. The key traits identified here that control moss-associated N2 fixation and cyanobacterial colonization could lead to improved predictions of N2 fixation in different moss species as a function of their morphology.},

abstract = {Temporally regulated microRNAs have been identified as master regulators of developmental timing in both animals and plants. In plants, vegetative development is regulated by a temporal decrease in miR156 level, but how this decreased expression is initiated and then maintained during shoot development remains elusive. Here, we show that miR159 is required for the correct timing of vegetative development in Arabidopsis thaliana. Loss of miR159 increases miR156 level throughout shoot development and delays vegetative development, whereas overexpression of miR159 slightly accelerated vegetative development. The repression of miR156 by miR159 is predominantly mediated by MYB33, an R2R3 MYB domain transcription factor targeted by miR159. Loss of MYB33 led to subtle precocious vegetative phase change phenotypes in spite of the significant downregulation of miR156. MYB33 simultaneously promotes the transcription of MIR156A and MIR156C, as well as their target, SPL9, by directly binding to the promoters of these three genes. Rather than acting as major players in vegetative phase change in Arabidopsis, our results suggest that miR159 and MYB33 function as modifiers of vegetative phase change; i.e., miR159 facilitates vegetative phase change by repressing MYB33 expression, thus preventing MYB33 from hyperactivating miR156 expression throughout shoot development to ensure correct timing of the juvenile-to-adult transition in Arabidopsis.},

Here, we report on the genomes of Azolla filiculoides and Salvinia cucullata (Salviniales) and present evidence for episodic whole-genome duplication in ferns—one at the base of ‘core leptosporangiates' and one specific to Azolla. One fern-specific gene that we identified, recently shown to confer high insect resistance, seems to have been derived from bacteria through horizontal gene transfer. Azolla coexists in a unique symbiosis with N2-fixing cyanobacteria, and we demonstrate a clear pattern of cospeciation between the two partners. Furthermore, the Azolla genome lacks genes that are common to arbuscular mycorrhizal and root nodule symbioses, and we identify several putative transporter genes specific to Azolla–cyanobacterial symbiosis. These genomic resources will help in exploring the biotechnological potential of Azolla and address fundamental questions in the evolution of plant life.},

abstract = {Management of nitrogen (N) inputs into agricultural systems is of increasing interest due to the intensive use of synthetic fertilizers in modern cash crop systems, which has caused considerable environmental damage, including nitrate contamination of surface and groundwater, eutrophication of coastal marine areas and emission of greenhouse gases. The use of legumes grown in rotations or intercropping is nowadays regarded as an alternative and sustainable way of introducing N into low-input cropping systems. In order to develop a simple tool to assess biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) by legume pulse and forages within crop rotations, we conducted a systematic literature survey with a quantitative statistical analysis intended to define a robust relationship between measurable variables and N2 fixation. We found highly significant correlations between total N accumulation in shoot matter and fixed N2 in forage ( y = 0.79x - 0.49) and grain ( y = 0.70x + 1.01) legumes. Accurately estimating the contribution of belowground components is more difficult because of a lack of relevant studies. Properly assessing BNF is crucial to evaluate the possibility of diversified legume based cropping systems achieving a balance between inputs and outputs, thus ensuring both short-term productivity and long-term sustainability. For a typical nine-year organic rotation in the Paris basin alternating legumes and cereals, the soil surface balance, calculated with the relationships obtained, indicated that N fluxes were balanced, leaving a surplus of only a few kg N/ha/yr, with legumes accounting for 86{\%} of total N inputs.},

abstract = {Regulation of the synthesis and activity of glutamine synthetase (GS) in the cyanobacterium Anabaena sp. strain 7120 was studied by determining GS transferase activity and GS antigen concentration under a variety of conditions. Extracts prepared from cells growing exponentially on a medium supplemented with combined nitrogen had a GS activity of 17 mumol of gamma-glutamyl transferase activity per min per mg of protein at 37 degrees C. This activity doubled in 12 h after transfer of cells to a nitrogen-free medium, corresponding to the time required for heterocyst differentiation and the start of nitrogen fixation. Addition of NH3 to a culture 11 h after an inducing transfer immediately blocked the increase in GS activity. In the Enterobacteriaceae, addition of NH3 after induction results in the covalent modification of GS by adenylylation. The GS of Anabaena is not adenylylated by such a protocol, as shown by the resistance of the transferase activity of the enzyme to inhibition by Mg2+ and by the failure of the enzyme to incorporate 32P after NH3 upshift. Methionine sulfoximine inhibited Anabaena GS activity rapidly and irreversibly in vivo. After the addition of methionine sulfoximine to Anabaena, the level of GS antigen neither increased nor decreased, indicating that Glutamine cannot be the only small molecule capable of regulating GS synthesis. Methionine sulfoximine permitted heterocyst differentiation and nitrogenase induction to escape repression by NH3. Nitrogen-fixing cultures treated with methionine sulfoximine excreted NH3. The fern Azolla caroliniana contains an Anabaena species living in symbiotic association. The Anabaena species carries out nitrogen fixation sufficient to satisfy all of the combined nitrogen requirements of the host fern. Experiments by other workers have shown that the activity of GS in the symbiont is significantly lower than the activity of GS in free-living Anabaena. Using a sensitive radioimmune assay and a normalization procedure based on the content of diaminopimelic acid, a component unique to the symbiont, we found that the level of GS antigen in the symbiont was about 5{\%} of the level in free-living Anabaena cells. Thus, the host fern appears to repress synthesis of Anabaena GS in the symbiotic association.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are {\~{}}21-nucleotide-long regulatory RNAs that arise from endonucleolytic processing of hairpin precursors. Many function as essential posttranscriptional regulators of target mRNAs and long noncoding RNAs. Alongside miRNAs, plants also produce large numbers of short interfering RNAs (siRNAs), which are distinguished from miRNAs primarily by their biogenesis (typically processed from long double-stranded RNA instead of single-stranded hairpins) and functions (typically via roles in transcriptional regulation instead of posttranscriptional regulation). Next-generation DNA sequencing methods have yielded extensive data sets of plant small RNAs, resulting in many miRNA annotations. However, it has become clear that many miRNA annotations are questionable. The sheer number of endogenous siRNAs compared with miRNAs has been a major factor in the erroneous annotation of siRNAs as miRNAs. Here, we provide updated criteria for the confident annotation of plant miRNAs, suitable for the era of “big data” from DNA sequencing. The updated criteria emphasize replication and the minimization of false positives, and they require next-generation sequencing of small RNAs. We argue that improved annotation systems are needed for miRNAs and all other classes of plant small RNAs. Finally, to illustrate the complexities of miRNA and siRNA annotation, we review the evolution and functions of miRNAs and siRNAs in plants.},

When exposed to VOCs of S. flexuosum, shoots of H. vernicosus elongated and emitted six times higher amounts of a compound chemically related to $\beta$-cyclocitral, which is employed in stress signalling and allelopathy in vascular plants. The VOCs emission was affected similarly by FR light addition, possibly simulating competition stress.

A metagenomic approach was taken complemented by detection of N2O released and nitrogen isotope determinations of fern biomass. Ribosomal RNA genes in sequenced DNA of natural ferns, their enriched leaf pockets and water filtrate from the surrounding ditch established that bacteria of A. filiculoides differed entirely from surrounding water and revealed species of the order Rhizobiales. Analyses of seven cultivated Azolla species confirmed persistent association with Rhizobiales. Two distinct nearly full-length Rhizobiales genomes were identified in leaf-pocket-enriched samples from ditch grown A. filiculoides. Their annotation revealed genes for denitrification but not N2-fixation. 15N2 incorporation was active in ferns with N. azollae but not in ferns without. N2O was not detectably released from surface-sterilized ferns with the Rhizobiales. N2-fixing N. azollae, we conclude, dominated the microbiome of Azolla ferns. The persistent but less abundant heterotrophic Rhizobiales bacteria possibly contributed to lowering O2 levels in leaf pockets but did not release detectable amounts of the strong greenhouse gas N2O.},

The enzyme has been previously characterized biochemically in fungi, but no structural information is available. Based on amino acid similarity 4,985 genes are annotated in the Gen- Bank™ as NMO. Of these, 4,424 (i.e. 89{\%}) are bacterial genes, including several Pseudomonads that have been shown to use P3N as growth substrate. Here, we have cloned and expressed the gene pa4202 of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1, purified the resulting protein, and characterized it. The enzyme is active on P3N and other alkyl nitronates, but cannot oxidize nitroalkanes. P3N is the best substrate at pH 7.5 and atmospheric oxygen with $\kappa$catapp/Κmapp of 12×106 M -1 s-1, $\kappa$catapp of 1300 s-1, and Κmapp of 110 $\mu$M. Anerobic reduction of the enzyme with P3N yields a flavosemiquinone, which is formed within 7.5 ms, consistent with this species being a catalytic intermediate. Absorption spectroscopy, mass spectrometry, and x-ray crystallography demonstrate a tightly, non-covalently bound FMN in the active site of the enzyme. Thus,PA4202is the first NMO identified and characterized in bacteria. The x-ray crystal structure of the enzyme was solved at 1.44 {\AA}, showing a TIM barrel-fold. Four motifs in common with the biochemically characterized NMO from Cyberlindnera saturnus are identified in the structure of bacterial NMO, defining Class I NMO, which includes bacterial, fungal, and two animal NMOs. Notably, the only otherNMOfrom Neurospora crassa for which biochemical evidence is available lacks the four motifs, defining Class IINMO. {\textcopyright} 2014 by The American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, Inc.},

Glucose and galactose were detected in the EPS of all the strains, while rhamnose was present only in the EPS of the strain L1 and uronic acids in B1 and ATCC 8010. Traces of fructose were detected by enzymatic assays in all the strains. The CPS contained glucose, galactose and rhamnose, while uronic acids were present only in strain B1. In all the strains the amount of EPS was higher than CPS. The reactivity to different dyes and lectins of the mucilagineous matrix of the algal packets extracted from the fern and of the bacterial mucilage were simliar. Source: BIOSIS},

abstract = {3-Nitropropionic acid (3NPA) is a widespread nitroaliphatic toxin found in a variety of legumes and fungi. Several enzymes have been reported that can transform the compound, but none led to the mineralization of 3NPA. We report here the isolation of bacteria that grow on 3NPA and its anion, propionate-3-nitronate (P3N), as the sole source of carbon, nitrogen, and energy. Experiments with resting cells, cell extracts, and purified enzymes indicate that the pathway involves conversion of 3NPA to P3N, which upon denitration yields malonic semialdehyde, nitrate, nitrite, and traces of H 2O2. Malonic semialdehyde is decarboxylated to acetyl coenzyme A. The gene that encodes the enzyme responsible for the denitration of P3N was cloned and expressed, and the enzyme was purified. Stoichiometry of the reaction indicates that the enzyme is a monooxygenase. The gene sequence is related to a large group of genes annotated as 2-nitropropane dioxygenases, but the P3N monooxygenase and closely related enzymes form a cluster within COG2070 that differs from previously characterized 2-nitropropane dioxygenases by their substrate specificities and reaction products. The results suggest that the P3N monooxygenases enable bacteria to exploit 3NPA in natural habitats as a growth substrate. Copyright {\textcopyright} 2010, American Society for Microbiology.

abstract = {The hrmA gene of the N2-fixing cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme functions in repressing the formation of transitory motile filaments, termed hormogonia, by plant-associated vegetative filaments. Here, we report that anthocyanins can contribute to induction of hrmA expression. Aqueous extract from fronds of the fern Azolla pinnata, a host of symbiotic Nostoc spp., was found to be a potent inducer of hrmA-luxAB in N. punctiforme strain UCD 328. The hrmA-luxAB inducing activities of A. pinnata, as well as Azolla filiculoides, were positively correlated with levels of frond deoxyanthocyanins. Analyses of the deoxyanthocyanins in frond extracts revealed, in order of predominance, an acetylated glycoside derivative of luteolinidin (m/z 475) and of apigeninidin (m/z 459) and minor amounts of a second luteolinidin derivative. At up to 150 $\mu$M, a purified preparation of deoxyanthocyanins only weakly induced hrmA-luxAB on its own, but mixtures with hrmA-luxAB inducers (A. filiculoides extract or the flavonoid naringin) synergistically doubled to tripled their inducing activities. These results suggest that appropriately localized deoxyanthocyanins could function in plant-mediated mechanisms for repressing Nostoc spp. hormogonium formation.},

Its extensible visualization approach distills multiple dimensions of information about each contig, offering a dynamic and unified work environment for data exploration, manipulation, and reporting. Using anvi'o, we re-analyzed publicly available datasets and explored temporal genomic changes within naturally occurring microbial populations through de novo characterization of single nucleotide variations, and linked cultivar and single-cell genomes with metagenomic and metatranscriptomic data.

@article{Tsuzuki2019,
abstract = {In angiosperms, the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth involves the de-repression of the squamosa promoter-binding-protein-like (SPL) class of transcription factors, which is negatively regulated by the specific microRNAs (miRNAs/miRs) miR156/529 [1]. Non-vascular land plants also undergo growth-phase transition to the reproductive state, but knowledge regarding the controlling mechanisms is limited. Here, we investigate the reproductive transition in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, focusing on the roles of miR529c [2–4] and MpSPL2. First, we established mir529c-null mutants using CRISPR/Cas9. Even in the absence of far-red light-supplemented long-day condition, which is usually needed to induce reproductive development [5, 6], the mutant thalli developed sexual reproductive organs (gametangia) and produced gametes. Transgenic plants expressing a miR529-resistant MpSPL2 transgene also showed a similar phenotype of reproductive transition in the absence of inductive far-red light signals. In these mutants and transgenic plants, the MpSPL2 mRNA abundance was elevated. Mpspl2ko mutant plants showed successful gamete development and fertilization, which suggests that MpSPL2 is involved in, but not essential for, sexual reproduction in M. polymorpha. Furthermore, analysis of Mpspl2ko mutant and its complemented lines suggests that MpSPL2 may have a role in promotion of reproductive transition. These findings support the notion that the transition to reproductive development in liverworts is controlled by a system similar to that in angiosperms, and the miR156/529-SPL module has common significance in the control of the vegetative-to-reproductive transition during development in many land plants, including liverworts.},

abstract = {We present here the hologenome theory of evolution, which considers the holobiont (the animal or plant with all of its associated microorganisms) as a unit of selection in evolution. The hologenome is defined as the sum of the genetic information of the host and its microbiota. The theory is based on four generalizations: (1) All animals and plants establish symbiotic relationships with microorganisms. (2) Symbiotic microorganisms are transmitted between generations. (3) The association between host and symbionts affects the fitness of the holobiont within its environment. (4) Variation in the hologenome can be brought about by changes in either the host or the microbiota genomes; under environmental stress, the symbiotic microbial community can change rapidly. These points taken together suggest that the genetic wealth of diverse microbial symbionts can play an important role both in adaptation and in evolution of higher organisms. During periods of rapid changes in the environment, the diverse microbial symbiont community can aid the holobiont in surviving, multiplying and buying the time necessary for the host genome to evolve. The distinguishing feature of the hologenome theory is that it considers all of the diverse microbiota associated with the animal or the plant as part of the evolving holobiont. Thus, the hologenome theory fits within the framework of the 'superorganism' proposed by Wilson and Sober.},

abstract = {Light, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy were used to follow sporocarp development in Azolla mexicana and the mechanism by which sporocarps become inoculated with symbiotic Anabaena. Packaging of the Anabaena into sporocarps is facilitated by branched epidermal trichomes, termed sporangial pair hairs. Sporocarps arc borne in pairs and arise from the ventral lobe initial of the first leaf of a lateral branch. Four sporangial fours ore associated with each sporangial pair from the onset of their development. These hairs differentiate rapidly and exhibit transfer cull ultrastructure. They protrude into the mass of undifferentiated Anabaena filaments which comprise the apical colony. Subsequently, the sporangial primordia and the sporangial hairs with in ten wined Anabaena filaments are displaced ventrally and covered by the developing involucre. A reservoir of Anabaena filaments is thus entrapped between the developing sporocarp pair and the lower surface of the involucre, A cup‐shaped indusium forms around the base of each sporangium, separating it from the sporangial hairs while entrapping the Anabaena filaments. As development continues, the indusia completely encapsulate the individual sporangia and engulf the Anabaena which is differentiating into akinetes. In mature megasporocarps the Anabaena cells are packaged into a chamber near the indusial pore and a cluster of simple trichomes occur external to the indusium around their base. The partner tabes of the developing sporangia form modified leaf cavities. These cavities are smaller than those in dorsal lobes not partnered with sporangia and they have a diminished complement of berth simple cavity trichomes and Anabaena. The Anabaena filaments in these modified cavities rapidly begin to differentiate akinetes rather than heterocysts. Factors which may contribute to akinete formation in the sporocarps and modified leaf cavities are discussed. Copyright {\textcopyright} 1993, Wiley Blackwell. All rights reserved},

abstract = {Evolutionary analyses require sequence alignments that correctly represent evolutionary homology. Evolutionary and structural homology are not the same and sequence alignments generated with methods designed for structural matching can be seriously misleading in comparative and phylogenetic analyses. The phylogeny-aware alignment algorithm implemented in the program prank has been shown to produce good alignments for evolutionary inferences. Unlike other alignment programs, prank makes use of phylogenetic information to distinguish alignment gaps caused by insertions or deletions and, thereafter, handles the two types of events differently. As a by-product of the correct handling of insertions and deletions, prank can provide the inferred ancestral sequences as a part of the output and mark the alignment gaps differently depending on their origin in insertion or deletion events. As the algorithm infers the evolutionary history of the sequences, prank can be sensitive to errors in the guide phylogeny and violations on the underlying assumptions about the origin and patterns of gaps. These issues are discussed in detail and practical advice for the use of prank in evolutionary analysis is provided.

The bootstrap method, which is based on resampling and replications, is used extensively to assess the robustness of phylogenetic inferences. However, increasing numbers of sequences are now available for a wide variety of species, and phylogenies based on hundreds or thousands of taxa are becoming routine. With phylogenies of this size Felsenstein's bootstrap tends to yield very low supports, especially on deep branches. Here we propose a new version of the phylogenetic bootstrap in which the presence of inferred branches in replications is measured using a gradual 'transfer' distance rather than the binary presence or absence index used in Felsenstein's original version. The resulting supports are higher and do not induce falsely supported branches. The application of our method to large mammal, HIV and simulated datasets reveals their phylogenetic signals, whereas Felsenstein's bootstrap fails to do so.},

abstract = {Enormous quantities of the free-floating freshwater fern Azolla grew and reproduced in situ in the Arctic Ocean during the middle Eocene, as was demonstrated by microscopic analysis of microlaminated sediments recovered from the Lomonosov Ridge during Integrated Ocean Drilling Program (IODP) Expedition 302. The timing of the Azolla phase (∼48.5 Ma) coincides with the earliest signs of onset of the transition from a greenhouse towards the modern icehouse Earth. The sustained growth of Azolla, currently ranking among the fastest growing plants on Earth, in a major anoxic oceanic basin may have contributed to decreasing atmospheric pCO2 levels via burial of Azolla-derived organic matter. The consequences of these enormous Azolla blooms for regional and global nutrient and carbon cycles are still largely unknown. Cultivation experiments have been set up to investigate the influence of elevated pCO 2 on Azolla growth, showing a marked increase in Azolla productivity under elevated (760 and 1910 ppm) pCO2conditions. The combined results of organic carbon, sulphur, nitrogen content and 15N and 13C measurements of sediments from the Azolla interval illustrate the potential contribution of nitrogen fixation in a euxinic stratified Eocene Arctic. Flux calculations were used to quantitatively reconstruct the potential storage of carbon (0.9-3.5 1018gC) in the Arctic during the Azolla interval. It is estimated that storing 0.9 1018to 3.5 10 18g carbon would result in a 55 to 470 ppm drawdown of pCO 2under Eocene conditions, indicating that the Arctic Azolla blooms may have had a significant effect on global atmospheric pCO2 levels through enhanced burial of organic matter. {\textcopyright} 2009 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.},

abstract = {High-throughput sequencing provides a fast and cost-effective mean to recover genomes of organisms from all domains of life. However, adequate curation of the assembly results against potential contamination of non-target organisms requires advanced bioinformatics approaches and practices. Here, we re-analyzed the sequencing data generated for the tardigrade Hypsibius dujardini, and created a holistic display of the eukaryotic genome assembly using DNA data originating from two groups and eleven sequencing libraries. By using bacterial single-copy genes, k-mer frequencies, and coverage values of scaffolds we could identify and characterize multiple near-complete bacterial genomes from the raw assembly, and curate a 182 Mbp draft genome for H. dujardini supported by RNA-Seq data. Our results indicate that most contaminant scaffolds were assembled from Moleculo long-read libraries, and most of these contaminants have differed between library preparations. Our re-analysis shows that visualization and curation of eukaryotic genome assemblies can benefit from tools designed to address the needs of today's microbiologists, who are constantly challenged by the difficulties associated with the identification of distinct microbial genomes in complex environmental metagenomes.},

abstract = {The hologenome concept of evolution postulates that the holobiont (host plus symbionts) with its hologenome (host genome plus microbiome) is a level of selection in evolution. Multicellular organisms can no longer be considered individuals by the classical definitions of the term. Every natural animal and plant is a holobiont consisting of the host and diverse symbiotic microbes and viruses. Microbial symbionts can be transmitted from parent to offspring by a variety of methods, including via cytoplasmic inheritance, coprophagy, direct contact during and after birth, and the environment. A large number of studies have demonstrated that these symbionts contribute to the anatomy, physiology, development, innate and adaptive immunity, and behavior and finally also to genetic variation and to the origin and evolution of species. Acquisition of microbes and microbial genes is a powerful mechanism for driving the evolution of complexity. Evolution proceeds both via cooperation and competition, working in parallel.},

abstract = {Phytochromes are red/far-red reversible photoreceptors essential for plant growth and development. Phytochrome signaling is mediated by the physiologically active far-red-absorbing Pfr form that can be inactivated to the red-absorbing Pr ground state by light-dependent photoconversion or by light-independent thermal reversion, also termed dark reversion. Although the term “dark reversion” is justified by historical reasons and frequently used in the literature, “thermal reversion” more appropriately describes the process of light-independent but temperature-regulated Pfr relaxation that not only occurs in darkness but also in light and is used throughout the review. Thermal reversion is a critical parameter for the light sensitivity of phytochrome-mediated responses and has been studied for decades, often resulting in contradictory findings. Thermal reversion is an intrinsic property of the phytochrome molecules but can be modulated by intra- and intermolecular interactions, as well as biochemical modifications, such as phosphorylation. In this review, we outline the research history of phytochrome thermal reversion, highlighting important predictions that have been made before knowing the molecular basis. We further summarize and discuss recent findings about the molecular mechanisms regulating phytochrome thermal reversion and its functional roles in light and temperature sensing in plants. Thermal reversion of phytochromes represents a light independent but temperature regulated inactivation mechanism. It is important for the light sensitivity of phytochrome mediated physiological responses in plants. This review summarizes the research history about phytochrome thermal reversion as well as advancements in understanding how thermal reversion is regulated in vivo.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: The number of prokaryotic genome sequences becoming available is growing steadily and is growing faster than our ability to accurately annotate them. DESCRIPTION: We describe a fully automated service for annotating bacterial and archaeal genomes. The service identifies protein-encoding, rRNA and tRNA genes, assigns functions to the genes, predicts which subsystems are represented in the genome, uses this information to reconstruct the metabolic network and makes the output easily downloadable for the user. In addition, the annotated genome can be browsed in an environment that supports comparative analysis with the annotated genomes maintained in the SEED environment.The service normally makes the annotated genome available within 12-24 hours of submission, but ultimately the quality of such a service will be judged in terms of accuracy, consistency, and completeness of the produced annotations. We summarize our attempts to address these issues and discuss plans for incrementally enhancing the service. CONCLUSION: By providing accurate, rapid annotation freely to the community we have created an important community resource. The service has now been utilized by over 120 external users annotating over 350 distinct genomes.},

abstract = {Many microRNAs (miRNAs) are encoded by small gene families. In a third of all conserved Arabidopsis miRNA families, members vary at two or more nucleotide positions. We have focused on the related miR159 and miR319 families, which share sequence identity at 17 of 21 nucleotides, yet affect different developmental processes through distinct targets. MiR159 regulates MYB mRNAs, while miR319 predominantly acts on TCP mRNAs. In the case of miR319, MYB targeting plays at most a minor role because miR319 expression levels and domain limit its ability to affect MYB mRNAs. In contrast, in the case of miR159, the miRNA sequence prevents effective TCP targeting. We complement these observations by identifying nucleotide positions relevant for miRNA activity with mutants recovered from a suppressor screen. Together, our findings reveal that functional specialization of miR159 and miR319 is achieved through both expression and sequence differences. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {Despite the large interest in the human microbiome in recent years, there are no reports of bacterial DNA methylation in the microbiome. Here metagenomic sequencing using the Pacific Biosciences platform allowed for rapid identification of bacterial GATC methylation status of a bacterial species in human stool samples. For this work, two stool samples were chosen that were dominated by a single species, Bacteroides dorei. Based on 16S rRNA analysis, this species represented over 45{\%} of the bacteria present in these two samples. The B. dorei genome sequence from these samples was determined and the GATC methylation sites mapped. The Bacteroides dorei genome from one subject lacked any GATC methylation and lacked the DNA adenine methyltransferase genes. In contrast, B. dorei from another subject contained 20,551 methylated GATC sites. Of the 4970 open reading frames identified in the GATC methylated B. dorei genome, 3184 genes were methylated as well as 1735 GATC methylations in intergenic regions. These results suggest that DNA methylation patterns are important to consider in multi-omic analyses of microbiome samples seeking to discover the diversity of bacterial functions and may differ between disease states.},

The timing of this transition is finely regulated by the integration of an array of environmental and endogenous factors. Nitrogen is the mineral macronutrient that plants require in the largest amount, and as such its availability greatly impacts on many aspects of plant growth and development, including flowering time. We found that nitrate signaling interacts with the age-related and gibberellic acid pathways to control flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. We revealed that repressors of flowering time belonging to the AP2-Type transcription factor family including SCHLAFMUTZE (SMZ) and SCHNARCHZAPFEN (SNZ) are important regulators of flowering time in response to nitrate. Our results support a model whereby nitrate activates SMZ and SNZ via the gibberellin pathway to repress flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana.},

To better understand the meristematic organization during leaf development and determinacy control, we analyzed the cell divisions and expression of Class I KNOX genes in Mickelia scandens, a fern that produces larger leaves with more pinnae in its climbing form than in its terrestrial form. We performed anatomical, in situ hybridization, and qRT-PCR experiments with histone H4 (cell division marker) and Class I KNOX genes. We found that Class I KNOX genes are expressed in shoot apical meristems, leaf apical meristems, and pinnae primordia. During early development, cell divisions occur in the most distal regions of the analyzed structures, including pinnae, and are not restricted to apical cells. Fern leaves and pinnae bear apical meristems that may partially act as indeterminate shoots, supporting the hypothesis of homology between shoots and leaves. Class I KNOX expression is correlated with indeterminacy in the apex and leaf of ferns, suggesting a conserved function for these genes in euphyllophytes with compound leaves.},

abstract = {Background: As key regulators of gene expression in eukaryotes, small RNAs have been characterized in many seed plants, and pathways for their biogenesis, degradation, and action have been defined in model angiosperms. However, both small RNAs themselves and small RNA pathways are not well characterized in other land plants such as lycophytes and ferns, preventing a comprehensive evolutionary perspective on small RNAs in land plants. Results: Using 25 representatives from major lineages of lycophytes and ferns, most of which lack sequenced genomes, we characterized small RNAs and small RNA pathways in these plants. We identified homologs of DICER-LIKE (DCL), ARGONAUTE (AGO), and other genes involved in small RNA pathways, predicted over 2600 conserved microRNA (miRNA) candidates, and performed phylogenetic analyses on small RNA pathways as well as miRNAs. Pathways underlying miRNA biogenesis, degradation, and activity were established in the common ancestor of land plants, but the 24-nucleotide siRNA pathway that guides DNA methylation is incomplete in sister species of seed plants, especially lycophytes. We show that the functional diversification of key gene families such as DCL and AGO as observed in angiosperms occurred early in land plants followed by parallel expansion of the AGO family in ferns and angiosperms. We uncovered a conserved AGO subfamily absent in angiosperms. Conclusions: Our phylogenetic analyses of miRNAs in bryophytes, lycophytes, ferns, and angiosperms refine the time-of-origin for conserved miRNA families as well as small RNA machinery in land plants.},

abstract = {Motivation: The enormous amount of short reads generated by the new DNA sequencing technologies call for the development of fast and accurate read alignment programs. A first generation of hash table-based methods has been developed, including MAQ, which is accurate, feature rich and fast enough to align short reads from a single individual. However, MAQ does not support gapped alignment for single-end reads, which makes it unsuitable for alignment of longer reads where indels may occur frequently. The speed of MAQ is also a concern when the alignment is scaled up to the resequencing of hundreds of individuals. Results: We implemented Burrows-Wheeler Alignment tool (BWA), a new read alignment package that is based on backward search with Burrows-Wheeler Transform (BWT), to efficiently align short sequencing reads against a large reference sequence such as the human genome, allowing mismatches and gaps. BWA supports both base space reads, e.g. from Illumina sequencing machines, and color space reads from AB SOLiD machines. Evaluations on both simulated and real data suggest that BWA is ∼10-20× faster than MAQ, while achieving similar accuracy. In addition, BWA outputs alignment in the new standard SAM (Sequence Alignment/Map) format. Variant calling and other downstream analyses after the alignment can be achieved with the open source SAMtools software package. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},

Elements of the algorithm include fast distance estimation using kmer counting, progressive alignment using a new profile function we call the log-expectation score, and refinement using tree-dependent restricted partitioning. The speed and accuracy of MUSCLE are compared with T-Coffee, MAFFT and CLUSTALW on four test sets of reference alignments: BAliBASE, SABmark, SMART and a new benchmark, PREFAB. MUSCLE achieves the highest, or joint highest, rank in accuracy on each of these sets. Without refinement, MUSCLE achieves average accuracy statistically indistinguishable from T-Coffee and MAFFT, and is the fastest of the tested methods for large numbers of sequences, aligning 5000 sequences of average length 350 in 7 min on a current desktop computer.

However, the size and diversity of the data sets produced by today's sequencing and array-based profiling methods present major challenges to visualization tools. The Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) is a high-performance viewer that efficiently handles large heterogeneous data sets, while providing a smooth and intuitive user experience at all levels of genome resolution. A key characteristic of IGV is its focus on the integrative nature of genomic studies, with support for both array-based and next-generation sequencing data, and the integration of clinical and phenotypic data. Although IGV is often used to view genomic data from public sources, its primary emphasis is to support researchers who wish to visualize and explore their own data sets or those from colleagues. To that end, IGV supports flexible loading of local and remote data sets, and is optimized to provide high-performance data visualization and exploration on standard desktop systems. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.

abstract = {The aim of the study was to determine the still not completely described microbiome associated with the aquatic fern Azolla filiculoides. During the experiment, 58 microbial isolates (43 epiphytes and 15 endophytes) with different morphologies were obtained. We successfully identified 85{\%} of microorganisms and assigned them to 9 bacterial genera: Achromobacter, Bacillus, Microbacterium, Delftia, Agrobacterium, and Alcaligenes (epiphytes) as well as Bacillus, Staphylococcus, Micrococcus, and Acinetobacter (endophytes). We also studied an A. filiculoides cyanobiont originally classified as Anabaena azollae; however, the analysis of its morphological traits suggests that this should be renamed as Trichormus azollae. Finally, the potential of the representatives of the identified microbial genera to synthesize plant growth-promoting substances such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA), cellulase and protease enzymes, siderophores and phosphorus (P) and their potential of utilization thereof were checked. Delftia sp. AzoEpi7 was the only one from all the identified genera exhibiting the ability to synthesize all the studied growth promoters; thus, it was recommended as the most beneficial bacteria in the studied microbiome. The other three potentially advantageous isolates (Micrococcus sp. AzoEndo14, Agrobacterium sp. AzoEpi25 and Bacillus sp. AzoEndo3) displayed 5 parameters: IAA (excluding Bacillus sp. AzoEndo3), cellulase, protease, siderophores (excluding Micrococcus sp. AzoEndo14), as well as mineralization and solubilization of P (excluding Agrobacterium sp. AzoEpi25).},

abstract = {The evolution of land flora transformed the terrestrial environment. Land plants evolved from an ancestral charophycean alga from which they inherited developmental, biochemical, and cell biological attributes. Additional biochemical and physiological adaptations to land, and a life cycle with an alternation between multicellular haploid and diploid generations that facilitated efficient dispersal of desiccation tolerant spores, evolved in the ancestral land plant. We analyzed the genome of the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, a member of a basal land plant lineage. Relative to charophycean algae, land plant genomes are characterized by genes encoding novel biochemical pathways, new phytohormone signaling pathways (notably auxin), expanded repertoires of signaling pathways, and increased diversity in some transcription factor families. Compared with other sequenced land plants, M. polymorpha exhibits low genetic redundancy in most regulatory pathways, with this portion of its genome resembling that predicted for the ancestral land plant.

abstract = {Land plants differentiate germ cells in the haploid gametophyte. In flowering plants, a generative cell is specified as a precursor that subsequently divides into two sperm cells in the developing male gametophyte, pollen. Generative cell specification requires cell-cycle control and microtubule-dependent nuclear relocation (reviewed in [1–3]). However, the generative cell fate determinant and its evolutionary origin are still unknown. In bryophytes, gametophytes produce eggs and sperm in multicellular reproductive organs called archegonia and antheridia, respectively, or collectively called gametangia. Given the monophyletic origin of land plants [4–6], evolutionarily conserved mechanisms may play key roles in these diverse reproductive processes. Here, we showed that a single member of the subfamily VIIIa of basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha primarily accumulated in the initial cells and controlled their development into gametangia. We then demonstrated that an Arabidopsis thaliana VIIIa bHLH transiently accumulated in the smaller daughter cell after an asymmetric division of the meiosis-derived microspore and was required for generative cell specification redundantly with its paralog. Furthermore, these A. thaliana VIIIa bHLHs were functionally replaceable by the M. polymorpha VIIIa bHLH. These findings suggest the VIIIa bHLH proteins as core regulators for reproductive development, including germ cell differentiation, since an early stage of land plant evolution. Land plants differentiate germ cells in the haploid gametophyte. Yamaoka et al. identify subfamily VIIIa bHLHs as core regulators for reproductive development in land plants: two members are required for generative cell specification in Arabidopsis thaliana, and a single member controls gametangial development in Marchantia polymorpha.},

Firstly, individual weights are assigned to each sequence in a partial alignment in order to downweight near-duplicate sequences and up-weight the most divergent ones. Secondly, amino acid substitution matrices are varied at different alignment stages according to the divergence of the sequences to be aligned. Thirdly, residue-specific gap penalties and locally reduced gap penalties in hydrophilic regions encourage new gaps in potential loop regions rather than regular secondary structure. Fourthly, positions in early alignments where gaps have been opened receive locally reduced gap penalties to encourage the opening up of new gaps at these positions.

abstract = {Recent years have witnessed major advances in our knowledge of plant mutualistic symbioses such as the rhizobium-legume symbiosis (RLS) and arbuscular mycorrhizas (AM). Some of these findings caused the revision of longstanding hypotheses, but one of the most solid theories is that a conserved set of plant proteins rules the transduction of symbiotic signals from beneficial glomeromycetes and rhizobia in a so-called common symbiotic pathway (CSP). Nevertheless, the picture still misses several elements, and a few crucial points remain unclear. How does one common pathway discriminate between – at least – two symbionts? Can we exclude that microbes other than AM fungi and rhizobia also use this pathway to communicate with their host plants?We here discuss the possibility that our current view is biased by a long-lasting focus on legumes, whose ability to develop both AM and RLS is an exception among plants and a recent innovation in their evolution; investigations in non-legumes are starting to place legume symbiotic signaling in a broader perspective. Furthermore, recent studies suggest that CSP proteins act in a wider scenario of symbiotic and non-symbiotic signaling. Overall, evidence is accumulating in favor of distinct activities for CSP proteins in AM and RLS, depending on the molecular and cellular context where they act},

abstract = {We have investigated the involvement of phytochrome B in the early-flowering response of Arabidopsis thaliana L. seedlings to low red:far-red (R/FR) ratio light conditions. The phytochrome B-deficient hy3 (phyB) mutant is early flowering, and in this regard it resembles the shade-avoidance phenotype of its isogenic wild type. Seedlings carrying the hy2 mutation, resulting in a deficiency of phytochrome chromophore and hence of active phytochromes, also flower earlier than wild-type plants. Whereas hy3 or hy2 seedlings show only a slight acceleration of flowering in response to low R/FR ratio, seedlings that are doubly homozygous for both mutations flower earlier than seedlings carrying either phytochrome-related mutation alone. This additive effect clearly indicates the involvement of one or more phytochrome species in addition to phytochrome B in the flowering response as well as indicating the presence of some functional phytochrome B in hy2 seedlings. Seedlings that are homozygous for the hy3 mutation and one of the fca, fwa, or co late-flowering mutations display a pronounced early-flowering response to low R/FR ratio. A similar response to low R/FR ratio is displayed by seedlings doubly homozygous for the hy2 mutation and any one of the late-flowering mutations. Thus, placing the hy3 or hy2 mutations into a late-flowering background has the effect of uncovering a flowering response to low R/FR ratio. Seedlings that are triply homozygous for the hy3, hy2 mutations and a late-flowering mutation flower earlier than the double mutants and do not respond to low R/FR ratio. Thus, the observed flowering responses to low R/FR ratio in phytochrome B-deficient mutants can be attributed to the action of at least one other phytochrome species.},

Activity cross-reactions between nitrogenase components showed the enhanced low-temperature activity to be associated with the Fe protein of V nitrogenase.

abstract = {Ferns and lycophytes are ubiquitous and charismatic members of many terrestrial ecosystems. Members of these lineages play key ecological roles in many of Earth's biomes and have an ancient fossil record dating back to the Devonian. Modern ferns underwent significant diversification in the Cretaceous, and the clade as a whole occupies a pivotal position in land plant evolution as the sister lineage to seed plants; lycophytes, in turn, are sister to ferns plus seed plants together. Both ferns and lycophytes are spore-bearing vascular plants, and each clade includes both homosporous and heterosporous members. Many taxa have large genomes with high numbers of chromosomes, particularly among the homosporous members of both lineages. They are the only two lineages of land plants that maintain independent gametophyte and sporophyte phases in their life cycle. Ferns are known to be prone to hybridization and polyploidy, but the roles these events have played in producing their large genomes are still unclear. Genome science has advanced dramatically in recent years, but genomic research in lycophytes and ferns has lagged behind other groups of plants. While nuclear genome sequences are now available for over 100 species of seed plants, there is only one sequenced genome of a lycophyte available (heterosporous Selaginella moellendorffii), and none from any fern, or from any homosporous vascular plant. This chapter reviews what is known about fern and lycophyte genomes (nuclear, chloroplast, and mitochondrial) and transcriptomes and presents an outlook on the future of genome research in these groups, including outstanding challenges in plant biology that will be illuminated by incorporating information on ferns and lycophytes. {\textcopyright} 2016 Elsevier Ltd.},

Heynh. When grown in continuous fluorescent illumination, four mutants (fca, fe, ft, and fy) and the Landsberg wild type exhibited a reduction in both flowering time and leaf number following 6 weeks of vernalization. A significant decrease in flowering time was also observed for all the mutants and the wild type when constant fluorescent illumination was supplemented with irradiation enriched in the red and far red regions of the spectrum. In the most extreme case, the late-flowering phenotype of the fca mutant was completely suppressed by vernalization, suggesting that this mutation has a direct effect on flowering. The fe and fy mutants also showed a more pronounced response than wild type to both vernalization and incandescent supplementation. The ft mutant showed a similar response to that of the wild type. The fb and fg mutants were substantially less sensitive to these treatments. These results are interpreted in the context of a multifactorial pathway for induction of flowering, in which the various mutations affect different steps of the pathway.},

We investigated floating ferns from the genus Azolla that host phototrophic diazotrophic Nostoc azollae in leaf pockets and belong to the fastest growing plants. Experimental production reported here demonstrated N-fertilizer independent production of nitrogen-rich biomass with an annual yield potential per ha of 1200 kg-1 N fixed and 35 t dry biomass. 15N2 fixation peaked at noon, reaching 0.4 mg N g-1 dry weight h-1. Azolla ferns therefore merit consideration as protein crops in spite of the fact that little is known about the fern's physiology to enable domestication. To gain an understanding of their nitrogen physiology, analyses of fern diel transcript profiles under differing nitrogen fertilizer regimes were combined with microscopic observations. Results established that the ferns adapted to the phototrophic N2-fixing symbionts N. azollae by 1) adjusting metabolically to nightly absence of N supply using responses ancestral to ferns and seed plants; 2) developing a specialized xylem-rich vasculature surrounding the leaf pocket organ; 3) responding to N-supply by controlling transcripts of genes mediating nutrient transport, allocation and vasculature development. Unlike other non-seed plants, the Azolla fern clock is shown to contain both the morning and evening loops; the evening loop is known to control rhythmic gene expression in the vasculature of seed plants and therefore may have evolved along with the vasculature in the ancestor of ferns and seed plants.},

We introduce bounded sparse dynamic programming (BSDP) to allow rapid approximation to exhaustive alignment. This is used within a framework whereby the alignment algorithms are described in terms of their underlying model, to allow automated development of efficient heuristic implementations which may be applied to a general set of sequence comparison problems. Results: The speed and accuracy of this approach compares favourably with existing methods. Examples of its use in the context of genome annotation are given.

abstract = {Motivation: Accurate alignment of high-throughput RNA-seq data is a challenging and yet unsolved problem because of the non-contiguous transcript structure, relatively short read lengths and constantly increasing throughput of the sequencing technologies. Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases.Results: To align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions, STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90{\%} success rate, corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy. {\textcopyright} The Author(s) 2012.

abstract = {The early evolutionary history of the chloroplast lineage remains an open question. It is widely accepted that the endosymbiosis that established the chloroplast lineage in eukaryotes can be traced back to a single event, in which a cyanobacterium was incorporated into a protistan host. It is still unclear, however, which Cyanobacteria are most closely related to the chloroplast, when the plastid lineage first evolved, and in what habitats this endosymbiotic event occurred. We present phylogenomic and molecular clock analyses, including data from cyanobacterial and chloroplast genomes using a Bayesian approach, with the aim of estimating the age for the primary endosymbiotic event, the ages of crown groups for photosynthetic eukaryotes, and the independent incorporation of a cyanobacterial endosymbiont by Paulinella. Our analyses include both broad taxon sampling (119 taxa) and 18 fossil calibrations across all Cyanobacteria and photosynthetic eukaryotes. Phylogenomic analyses support the hypothesis that the chloroplast lineage diverged from its closet relative Gloeomargarita, a basal cyanobacterial lineage, {\~{}}2.1 billion y ago (Bya). Our analyses suggest that the Archaeplastida, consisting of glaucophytes, red algae, green algae, and land plants, share a common ancestor that lived {\~{}}1.9 Bya. Whereas crown group Rhodophyta evolved in the Mesoproterozoic Era (1,600–1,000 Mya), crown groups Chlorophyta and Streptophyta began to radiate early in the Neoproterozoic (1,000–542 Mya). Stochastic mapping analyses indicate that the first endosymbiotic event occurred in low-salinity environments. Both red and green algae colonized marine environments early in their histories, with prasinophyte green phytoplankton diversifying 850–650 Mya.},

abstract = {Awareness that our planet is a self-supporting biosphere with sunlight as its major source of energy for life has resulted in a long-term historical fascination with the workings of self-supporting ecological systems. However, the studies of such systems have never entered the canon of ecological or evolutionary tools and instead, have led a fringe existence connected to life support system engineering and space travel. We here introduce a framework for a renaissance in biospherics based on the study of matter-closed, energy-open ecosystems at a microbial level (microbial biospherics). Recent progress in genomics, robotics, and sensor technology makes the study of closed systems now much more tractable than in the past, and we argue that the time has come to emancipate the study of closed systems from this fringe context and bring them into a mainstream approach for studying ecosystem processes. By permitting highly replicated long-term studies, especially on predetermined and simplified systems, microbial biospheres offer the opportunity to test and develop strong hypotheses about ecosystem function and the ecological and evolutionary determinants of long-term system failure or persistence. Unlike many sciences, ecosystem ecology has never fully embraced a reductionist approach and has remained focused on the natural world in all its complexity. We argue that a reductionist approach to ecosystem ecology, using microbial biospheres, based on a combination of theory and the replicated study of much simpler self-enclosed microsystems could pay huge dividends.},

abstract = {The ontological changes in cyanobacterial ultrastructure, including akinete germination and heterocyst differentiation, during the propagation of mature sporophytes from Azolla microphylla sporocarps were examined using transmission electron microscopy. Rehydrated Azolla megasporocarps contained cyanobacterial akinetes having a multilayered envelope and large amounts of cyanophycin and glycogen. Concomitant with the initial stages of sporocarp germination was the formation of vegetative cyanobacterial cells via germination of akinetes. Once fem plantlets had four visible leaves, vegetative cyanobacterial cells had begun to differentiate into heterocysts in the cavity of the oldest leaf; this timing was very similar to that observed in vegetatively reproducing sporophytes. Ultrastructural characteristics of vegetative cyanobacterial cells present at the apical meristem of plants generated either by sporocarp germination or vegetative propagation were indistinguishable. These cells remained in an undifferentiated state regardless of plant age. However, as in vegetatively propagated plants, the cyanobacterial population and ultrastructural characteristics of cells in older leaf cavities were exceedingly diverse. This is the first report that groups of pleomorphic eubacteria are contained beneath the indusium of rehydrated Azolla microphylla megasporocarps. Concomitant with the early morphological changes of germination of Azolla megasporocarps and endosymbiotic akinetes was the initiation of cell division by the eubacteria.},

abstract = {During land plant evolution, determinate spore-bearing axes (retained in extant bryophytes such as mosses) were progressively transformed into indeterminate branching shoots with specialized reproductive axes that form flowers. The LEAFY transcription factor, which is required for the first zygotic cell division in mosses and primarily for floral meristem identity in flowering plants, may have facilitated developmental innovations during these transitions. Mapping the LEAFY evolutionary trajectory has been challenging, however, because there is no functional overlap between mosses and flowering plants, and no functional data from intervening lineages. Here, we report a transgenic analysis in the fern Ceratopteris richardii that reveals a role for LEAFY in maintaining cell divisions in the apical stem cells of both haploid and diploid phases of the lifecycle. These results support an evolutionary trajectory in which an ancestral LEAFY module that promotes cell proliferation was progressively co-opted, adapted and specialized as novel shoot developmental contexts emerged.},

abstract = {Heterosporous water ferns (Marsileaceae and Salviniaceae) are the only extant group of plants to have evolved heterospory since the Paleozoic. These ferns possess unusual reproductive structures traditionally termed "sporocarps." Using an evolutionary framework, we critically examine the complex homology issues pertaining to these structures. Comparative morphological study reveals that all heterosporous ferns bear indusiate sori on a branched, nonlaminate structure that we refer to as the sorophore; this expanded definition highlights homology previously obscured by the use of different terms. By using a homology-based concept, we aim to discontinue the use of historically and functionally based morphological terminology. We recognize the sorophore envelope as a structure that surrounds the sorophore and sori. The sorophore envelope is present in Marsileaceae as a sclerenchymatous sporocarp wall and in Azolla as a parenchymatous layer, but it is absent in Salvinia. Both homology assessments and phylogenetic character-state reconstructions using the Cretaceous fossil Hydropteris are consistent with a single origin of the sorophore envelope in heterosporous ferns. Consequently, we restrict the term "sporocarp" to a sorophore envelope and all it contains. Traditional usage of "sporocarp" is misleading because it implies homology for nonhomologous structures, and structures historically called sporocarps in Salviniaceae are more appropriately referred to as sori. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The University of Chicago.

@article{Srivastava2014,
abstract = {Background: Deep-sequencing has enabled the identification of large numbers of miRNAs and siRNAs, making the high-throughput target identification a main limiting factor in defining their function. In plants, several tools have been developed to predict targets, majority of them being trained on Arabidopsis datasets. An extensive and systematic evaluation has not been made for their suitability for predicting targets in species other than Arabidopsis. Nor, these have not been evaluated for their suitability for high-throughput target prediction at genome level. Results: We evaluated the performance of 11 computational tools in identifying genome-wide targets in Arabidopsis and other plants with procedures that optimized score-cutoffs for estimating targets. Targetfinder was most efficient [89{\%} 'precision' (accuracy of prediction), 97{\%} 'recall' (sensitivity)] in predicting 'true-positive' targets in Arabidopsis miRNA-mRNA interactions. In contrast, only 46{\%} of true positive interactions from non-Arabidopsis species were detected, indicating low 'recall' values. Score optimizations increased the 'recall' to only 70{\%} (corresponding 'precision': 65{\%}) for datasets of true miRNA-mRNA interactions in species other than Arabidopsis. Combining the results of Targetfinder and psRNATarget delivers high true positive coverage, whereas the intersection of psRNATarget and Tapirhybrid outputs deliver highly 'precise' predictions. The large number of 'false negative' predictions delivered from non-Arabidopsis datasets by all the available tools indicate the diversity in miRNAs-mRNA interaction features between Arabidopsis and other species. A subset of miRNA-mRNA interactions differed significantly for features in seed regions as well as the total number of matches/mismatches.Conclusion: Although, many plant miRNA target prediction tools may be optimized to predict targets with high specificity in Arabidopsis, such optimized thresholds may not be suitable for many targets in non-Arabidopsis species. More importantly, non-conventional features of miRNA-mRNA interaction may exist in plants indicating alternate mode of miRNA target recognition. Incorporation of these divergent features would enable next-generation of algorithms to better identify target interactions. {\textcopyright} 2014 Srivastava et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Light regulates various aspects of development throughout the life cycle of sessile land plants. Photoreceptors, such as the red (R) and far-red (FR) light receptors phytochromes, play pivotal roles in modulating developmental programs. Reflecting high developmental plasticity, plants can regenerate tissues, organs, and whole bodies from varieties of cells. Among land plants, bryophytes exhibit extraordinary competency of regeneration under hormone-free conditions. As an environmental factor, light plays critical roles in regeneration of bryophytes. However, how light regulates regeneration remains unknown. Here we show that using the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, which contains a single phytochrome gene, the phytochrome regulates re-entry into the cell cycle and cell shape in newly regenerating tissues. Our morphological and cytological observations revealed that S-phase entry of G1-arrested epidermal cells around the midrib on the ventral surface of thallus explants was greatly retarded in the dark or under phytochrome-inactive R/FR cycle irradiation conditions, where, nevertheless, small, laterally narrow regenerants were eventually formed. Thus, consistent with earlier descriptions published over a century ago, light is not essential for, but exerts profound effects on regeneration in M. polymorpha. Ventral cells in regenerants grown under R/FR cycle conditions were longer and narrower than those under R cycle. Expression of a constitutively active mutant of M. polymorpha phytochrome allowed regeneration of well grown, widely expanded thalli even in the dark when sugar was supplied, further demonstrating that the phytochrome signal promotes cell proliferation, which is rate-limited by sucrose availability. Similar effects of R and FR irradiation on cell division and elongation were observed in sporelings as well. Thus, besides activation of photosynthesis, major roles of R in regeneration of M. polymorpha are to facilitate proliferation of rounder cells through the phytochrome by mechanisms that are likely to operate in the sporeling.},

abstract = {Understanding the biological stability of drinking water distribution systems is imperative in the framework of process control and risk management. The objective of this research was to examine the dynamics of the bacterial community during drinking water distribution at high temporal resolution. Water samples (156 in total) were collected over short time-scales (minutes/hours/days) from the outlet of a treatment plant and a location in its corresponding distribution network. The drinking water is treated by biofiltration and disinfectant residuals are absent during distribution. The community was analyzed by 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing and flow cytometry as well as conventional, culture-based methods. Despite a random dramatic event (detected with pyrosequencing and flow cytometry but not with plate counts), the bacterial community profile at the two locations did not vary significantly over time. A diverse core microbiome was shared between the two locations (58-65{\%} of the taxa and 86-91{\%} of the sequences) and found to be dependent on the treatment strategy. The bacterial community structure changed during distribution, with greater richness detected in the network and phyla such as Acidobacteria and Gemmatimonadetes becoming abundant. The rare taxa displayed the highest dynamicity, causing the major change during water distribution. This change did not have hygienic implications and is contingent on the sensitivity of the applied methods. The concept of biological stability therefore needs to be revised. Biostability is generally desired in drinking water guidelines but may be difficult to achieve in large-scale complex distribution systems that are inherently dynamic.},

They resulted from primary endosymbiotic events that seem to share general features, i.e., an acquisition of a bacterium/cyanobacteria likely via a phagocytic membrane, a genome reduction coinciding with an escape of genes from the organelle to the nucleus, and finally the appearance of an active system translocating nuclear-encoded proteins back to the organelles. An intense mobilization of foreign genes of bacterial origin, via horizontal gene transfers, plays a critical role. Some third partners, like Chlamydia, might have facilitated the transition from cyanobacteria to the early chloroplast. This chapter describes our current understanding of primary endosymbiosis, with a specific focus on primary chloroplasts considered to have emerged more than one billion years ago, and on the chromatophore, having emerged about one hundred million years ago.},

There was a direct linear relationship between numbers of these bacteria and leaf age in Azolla caroliniana, A. mexicana, and A. filiculoides (r2 = 0.90 or greater, P{\textless} 0.01), while no such relationship was found in A. pinnata which contained fewer numbers of bacteria.

Bacteria were observed in all leaf cavities of Azolla cultures. Five ultrastructurally distinct types of bacteria were observed in each individual leaf cavity. Features used to characterize the bacteria included morphology, cell wall structure, and cytoplasmic organization. At least one gram-positive and as many as four gram-negative types of bacteria reside in leaf cavities of A. caroliniana. The morphological and ultrastructural characteristics of the gram-positive bacterium suggest that it is an Arthrobacter sp. The gram-negative bacteria could not be cultured; therefore, they have not been classified further. Bacteria cell shape and cell wall structure were similar in leaf cavities of different ages, but cell size and cytoplasmic composition varied. The relative contributions of each bacterial type to the total community within individual leaves was determined. Ultrastructural characteristics of bacterial isolates cultured from A. caroliniana in a free-living state were also examined.},

abstract = {Various plant species establish intimate symbioses with bacteria within their aerial organs. The bacteria are contained within nodules or glands often present in distinctive patterns on the leaves in what is commonly referred to as leaf nodule symbiosis. We describe here a highly specific symbiosis between a wild yam species from Madagascar, Dioscorea sansibarensis and bacteria of the species Orrella dioscoreae. Using whole-genome sequencing of plastids and bacteria from wild-collected samples, we show phylogenetic patterns consistent with a dominant vertical mode of transmission of the symbionts. Unique so far among leaf nodule symbioses, the bacteria can be cultured and are amenable to comparative transcriptomics, revealing a potential role in complementing the host's arsenal of secondary metabolites. We propose a recent establishment of a vertical mode of transmission in this symbiosis which, together with a large effective population size explains the cultivability and apparent lack of genome reductive evolution in O. dioscoreae. We leverage these unique features to reveal pathways and functions under positive selection in these specialized endophytes, highlighting the candidate mechanisms enabling a permanent association in the phyllosphere.},

abstract = {Land plants have evolved a series of photoreceptors to precisely perceive environmental information. Among these, phytochromes are the sole photoreceptors for red light (R) and far-red light (FR), and play pivotal roles in modulating various developmental processes. Most extant land plants possess multiple phytochromes that probably evolved from a single phytochrome in the common ancestor of land plants. However, the ancestral phytochrome signaling mechanism remains unknown due to a paucity of knowledge regarding phytochrome functions in basal land plants. It has recently been reported that Mpphy, a single phytochrome in the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, regulates typical photoreversible responses collectively classified as low fluence response (LFR). Here, we show that Mpphy also regulates the gametangiophore formation analogous to the mode of action of the far-red high irradiance response (FR-HIR) in angiosperms. Our phenotypic analyses using mutant plants obtained by CRISPR/Cas9-based genome editing revealed that MpFHY1, an ortholog of FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL1, as well as Mpphy is critical for the FR-HIR signaling in M. polymorpha. In addition, knockout of MpPIF, a single PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR gene in M. polymorpha, completely abolished the FR-HIR-dependent gametangiophore formation, while overexpression of MpPIF accelerated the response. FR-HIR-dependent transcriptional regulation was also disrupted in the Mppif mutant. Our findings suggest that plants had already acquired the FR-HIR signaling mediated by phytochrome and PIF at a very early stage during the course of land plant evolution, and that a single phytochrome in the common ancestor of land plants could mediate both LFR and FR-HIR.},

abstract = {Rhizobia are soil bacteria that are able to fix nitrogen in symbiosis with plants from the family Leguminosae. Rhizobia populate both soil and nodule niches. The rhizobial genome can be divided into a core of housekeeping genes and an accessory pool of non-essential genes. The accessory genome, together with factors acting within plants, confers symbiotic interaction between rhizobia and plant hosts. Rhizobia are distributed within the $\alpha$ - and $\beta$ subdivisions of the Proteobacteria and intermingled with non-symbiotic photosynthetic and pathogenic relatives in the following genera: Allorhizobium , Azorhizobium , Bradyrhizobium , Mesorhizobium , Rhizobium , Sinorhizobium and Methylobacterium ( $\alpha$ -rhizobia), as well as Burkholderia and Cupriavidus ( $\beta$ -rhizobia). Recently $\alpha$ -proteobacterial nitrogen-fixing isolates have been identified in the genera Ochrobactrum, Devosia and Blastobacter . Lateral gene transfer of the mobile accessory genome is the most likely explanation for the occurrence of rhizobial symbiotic loci in distantly related genera of proteobacteria. Consequently, similar symbiotic types can be found in different chromosomal backgrounds, and the same chromosomal background can harbour different symbiotic genotypes. Thus, comparisons of genes from core loci and the accessory gene pool reflect their separate evolutionary histories. Similarly, phylogenies from ribosomal sequences of rhizobia do not show parallel divergence with plant taxonomy. Phylogenies of closely evolving organisms might develop in parallel. In the case of rhizobia, only phylogenetic trees based on symbiotic genes show some correlation with host plant range, indicating that evolution of nodulation genes could develop under the functional constraint of the plant.},

Results: We updated miRDeep-P to miRDeep-P2 (miRDP2) by employing a new filtering strategy and overhauling the algorithm. miRDP2 has been tested against miRNA transcriptomes in plants with increasing genome sizes that included Arabidopsis, rice, tomato, maize and wheat. Compared with miRDeep-P and several other computational tools, miRDP2 processes next-generation sequencing data with superior speed. By incorporating newly updated plant miRNA annotation criteria and developing a new scoring system, the accuracy of miRDP2 outperformed other programs. Taken together, our results demonstrate miRDP2 as a fast and accurate tool for analyzing themiRNA transcriptome in plants.},

abstract = {BACKGROUND: Since available arable land is limited and nitrogen fertilizers pollute the environment, cropping systems ought to be developed that do not rely on them. Here we investigate the rapidly growing, N2-fixing Azolla/Nostoc symbiosis for its potential productivity and chemical composition to determine its potential as protein feed. RESULTS: In a small production system, cultures of Azolla pinnata and Azolla filiculoides were continuously harvested for over 100 days, yielding an average productivity of 90.0–97.2 kg dry weight (DW) ha−1 d−1. Under ambient CO2 levels, N2 fixation by the fern's cyanobacterial symbionts accounted for all nitrogen in the biomass. Proteins made up 176–208 g kg−1 DW (4.9 × total nitrogen), depending on species and CO2 treatment, and contained more essential amino acids than protein from soybean. Elevated atmospheric CO2 concentrations (800 ppm) significantly boosted biomass production by 36–47{\%}, without decreasing protein content. Choice of species and CO2 concentrations further affected the biomass content of lipids (79–100 g kg−1 DW) and (poly)phenols (21–69 g kg−1 DW). CONCLUSIONS: By continuous harvesting, high protein yields can be obtained from Azolla cultures, without the need for nitrogen fertilization. High levels of (poly)phenols likely contribute to limitations in the inclusion rate of Azolla in animal diets and need further investigation. {\textcopyright} 2018 The Authors.

abstract = {PhyML is a phylogeny software based on the maximum-likelihood principle. Early PhyML versions used a fast algorithm performing nearest neighbor interchanges to improve a reasonable starting tree topology. Since the original publication (Guindon S., Gascuel O. 2003. A simple, fast and accurate algorithm to estimate large phylogenies by maximum likelihood. Syst. Biol. 52:696-704), PhyML has been widely used ({\textgreater}2500 citations in ISI Web of Science) because of its simplicity and a fair compromise between accuracy and speed. In the meantime, research around PhyML has continued, and this article describes the new algorithms and methods implemented in the program. First, we introduce a new algorithm to search the tree space with user-defined intensity using subtree pruning and regrafting topological moves. The parsimony criterion is used here to filter out the least promising topology modifications with respect to the likelihood function. The analysis of a large collection of real nucleotide and amino acid data sets of various sizes demonstrates the good performance of this method. Second, we describe a new test to assess the support of the data for internal branches of a phylogeny. This approach extends the recently proposed approximate likelihood-ratio test and relies on a nonparametric, Shimodaira-Hasegawa-like procedure. A detailed analysis of real alignments sheds light on the links between this new approach and the more classical nonparametric bootstrap method. Overall, our tests show that the last version (3.0) of PhyML is fast, accurate, stable, and ready to use. A Web server and binary files are available from http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/.},

Treatments of the fern with antibiotics to which Anabaena and/or bacteria are sensitive, did not change the qualitative composition of polysaccharides, but altered the amount of single monosaccharides. Fucose was the most abundant monosaccharide, both in treated and in untreated plants, suggesting its plant origin. The amount of glucose and galactose in erythromycin treated Azolla decreased, suggesting that these monosaccharides are produced both by Anabaena and by bacteria. Lectin binding was observed microscopically using fluorescein isothiocyanate-labelled lectins. Algal packet polysaccharides of untreated plants had glucose as hapten, which was also revealed on the surface of both Anabaena and bacteria. Galactose was a hapten both of the mucilage and of the bacteria. Hypotheses about the contribution of each component of the symbiosis to the mucilage production are put forward.},

Legume-rhizobia symbiosis could be an effective and environmental-friendly alternative to nitrogen fertilization and hence, to mitigate soil N2O emissions. However, legume crops also contribute to N2O emissions. A better understanding of the environmental factors involved in the emission of N2O from nodules would be instrumental for mitigating the release of this GHG gas. In this work, in vivo N2O emissions from nodulated soybean roots in response to nitrate (0, 1, 2 and 4 mM) and flooding have been measured. To investigate the contribution of rhizobial denitrification in N2O emission from nodules, plants were inoculated with B. japonicum USDA110 and napA and nosZ denitrification mutants. The results showed that nitrate was essential for N2O emissions and its concentration enhanced N2O fluxes showing a statistical linear correlation, being the highest N2O fluxes obtained with 4 mM nitrate. When inoculated plants grown with 4 mM nitrate were subjected to flooding, a 150- and 830-fold induction of N2O emission rates from USDA110 and nosZ nodulated roots, respectively, was observed compared to non-flooded plants, especially during long-term flooding. Under these conditions, N2O emissions from detached nodules produced by the napA mutant were significantly lower (p {\textless} 0.05) than those produced by the wild-type strain (382 versus 1120 nmol N2O h−1 g−1 NFW, respectively). In contrast, nodules from plants inoculated with the nosZ mutant accumulated statistically higher levels of N2O compared to wild-type nodules (2522 versus nmol 1120 N2O h−1 g−1 NFW, p {\textless} 0.05). These results demonstrate that flooding is an important environmental factor for N2O emissions from soybean nodules and that B. japonicum denitrification is involved in such emission.},

Morphological analyses revealed differences between the free-living isolates and their symbiotic counterparts, as did restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analyses with both single-copy glnA and rbcS gene probes and a multicopy psbA gene probe. RFLP analyses with Anabaena sp. strain PCC 7120 nifD excision element probes, including an xisA gene probe, detected homologous sequences in DNA extracted from the free-living isolates. Sequences homologous to these probes were not detected in DNA from the symbiotically associated cyanobacteria. These analyses indicated that the isolates were not identical to the major cyanobacterial symbiont species residing in leaf cavities of Azolla spp. Nevertheless, striking similarities between several free-living isolates were observed. In every instance, the isolate from A. pinnata displayed banding patterns virtually identical to those of free-living cultures previously isolated from Azolla caroliniana and Azolla filiculoides. These results suggest the ubiquitous presence of a culturable minor cyanobacterial symbiont in at least three species of Azolla.},

abstract = {Phytochromes are plant photoreceptors important for development and adaptation to the environment. Phytochrome A (PHYA) is essential for the far-red (FR) high-irradiance responses (HIRs), which are of particular ecological relevance as they enable plants to establish under shade conditions. PHYA and HIRs have been considered unique to seed plants because the divergence of seed plants and cryptogams (e.g., ferns and mosses) preceded the evolution of PHYA. Seed plant phytochromes translocate into the nucleus and regulate gene expression. By contrast, there has been little evidence of a nuclear localization and function of cryptogam phytochromes. Here, we identified responses to FR light in cryptogams, which are highly reminiscent of PHYA signaling in seed plants. In the moss Physcomitrella patens and the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris, phytochromes accumulate in the nucleus in response to light. Although P. patens phytochromes evolved independently of PHYA, we have found that one clade of P. patens phytochromes exhibits the molecular properties of PHYA. We suggest that HIR-like responses had evolved in the last common ancestor of modern seed plants and cryptogams and that HIR signaling is more ancient than PHYA. Thus, other phytochromes in seed plants may have lost the capacity to mediate HIRs during evolution, rather than that PHYA acquired it.},

@article{Raven1998,
abstract = {Ammonia was necessary for the origin of life. However, NH3 would not have been a significant component of the neutral or mildly reducing (N2, CO2, H2O) atmosphere which characterized the Hadean earth ({\textgreater} 3.8 Gyr ago), especially in view of the u.v. lability of NH3, the greater u.v. output of the young sun than pertains today, and the absence of an atmospheric u.v. screen. Heterogeneous phase reactions, following atmospheric chemistry, have been proposed as a prebiotic NH3 source. Lightning, or bolides (meteorites and comets), generated NO(x)., and Fe2+ in the sea could have reduced NO2- resulting from the NO(x). to NH4+; this disequilibrium NH4+ level could have supported the production of the nitrogenous organic building blocks of life. NO(x). and NH(y) thus could both have had important roles in the origin and evolution of life. Burgeoning biota could soon have depleted abiotically generated NH4+, and biological N2 fixation could have evolved in its present Fe-demanding, O2-sensitive forms in the Archaean O2-free, Fe2+-rich environment. Organic matter could have driven biological denitrification reactions based on NO2- and NO3- generated abiologically using some redox components which evolved in earlier chemolithotrophs and photolithotrophs, regenerating atmospheric NO(x). and producing N2O. Any atmospheric NH3 leaking from oceanic biology would have been subject to u.v. breakdown and rain-out. Although O2-evolving photosynthesis probably began in the Archean some 3.5 Gyr ago, any O2 accumulation was local until 2.0 Gyr ago (Proterozoic) due to consumption by oxidation of Fe2+ and S2-. However, localized O2 accumulation before 2.0 Gyr ago could account for the observed early evolution of cytochrome oxidase and the possibility of O2-consuming chemolithotrophic and chemoorganotrophic nitrification, with further possibilities of NO(x). production. Oxygen accumulation globally from 2.0 Gyr onwards coincided approximately with the evolution of eukaryotes, which contributed phagotrophy to the reactions of the N cycle as well as the nutrification-like aerobic production of NO. by nitric oxide synthetase, while lightning and bolides could now generate NO. from N2 and O2. Evidence for terrestrial ecosystems is found from 1.0 Gyr onwards; NO(x). and NH2 generated by terrestrial biota stands a greater chance of escaping to the atmosphere than do these compounds generated in the sea where recycling within the water body is likely. As CO2 levels fell and O2 levels rose, NH3 cycling in the photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycle might have been evident as early as 1 Gyr ago, although this does not seem to be a major contributor to atmospheric NH3 today. Embryophyte evolution on land 450 Myr ago, together with symbionts and biophages, increased primary productivity and N cycling on land, with greater quantitative possibilities for NO(x). and NH3 escape to the atmosphere. The evolution of lignin (and related phenylpropanoids) at least 400 Myr ago, with associated NH3 recycling in vascular land plant, does not seem (on present evidence) to increase NH3 loss to the atmosphere significantly. Biomass burning occurred at least 350 Myr ago with lightning as the likely ignition source; such burning yielded NO., NH3, N2O and N2 from organic N. As in earlier times, the existence of terrestrial embryophyte vegetation has been punctuated by major bolide impacts, with the Cretaceous-Tertiary boundary impact generating perhaps 104 as much NO. as a year's thunderstorms do today, although the toxicity of NO(x). per se to vegetation might not have been the major effect of the NO(x). on biota. Terrestrial plants suffered fewer extinctions at this time than did many other major taxa. Despite such very significant generators of atmospheric combined N as major bolide impacts, the mean levels of NH(y), NO(x). and N2O (and O3) in the atmosphere during the 450 Myr existence of embryophyte vegetation was lower than the current, globally averaged, anthropogenically influenced values. Current globally averaged levels of atmospheric combined N are thus not without precedent in the history of life, globally for NO(x)., and locally for NH(y), so vegetation has had evolutionary experience of high atmospheric combined N. However, this should not make us complacent about the impact of current wide-spread and continuing anthropogenic inputs of combined N, in view of the rate and extent of the inputs, and their combination with other aspects of local anthropogenic influence (e.g. SO2 from burning of high-S coal), stratospheric O3 depletion, and global environmental change (increasing CO2, temperature and sea-level).},

abstract = {Light and temperature patterns are often correlated under natural plant growth conditions. In this review, we analyse the perception and signalling mechanisms shared by both these environmental cues and discuss the functional implications of their convergence to control plant growth. The first point of integration is the phytochrome B (phyB) receptor, which senses light and temperature. Downstream of phyB, the signalling core comprises two branches, one involving PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) and the other CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5). The dynamics of accumulation and/or localization of each of these core signalling components depend on light and temperature conditions. These pathways are connected through COP1, which enhances the activity of PIF4. The circadian clock modulates this circuit, since EARLY FLOWERING 3 (ELF3), an essential component of the evening complex (EC), represses expression of the PIF4 gene and PIF4 transcriptional activity. Phytochromes are probably not the only entry point of temperature into this network, but other sensors remain to be established. The sharing of mechanisms of action for two distinct environmental cues is to some extent unexpected, as it renders these responses mutually dependent. There are nonetheless many ecological contexts in which such a mutual influence could be beneficial.},

abstract = {Transcription factors encoded by the large MADS-box gene family have important developmental functions in angiosperms, the flowering plants. Mutations in certain MADS-box genes are known to cause homeotic alterations in floral organ identity, and the establishment of floral organ identity is the most well-studied developmental process in which MADS-box genes are known to function. Our interest is in the potential connection between the duplication history of this gene family and the evolutionary origin of the structures that the different MADS-box genes developmentally regulate in plants. Previous studies have demonstrated that the origin of the MADS-box genes that control floral organ identity predate the evolutionary origin of the flower itself, since gymnosperms have genes that are orthologous to angiosperm floral homeotic MADS-box genes, whereas ferns appear to lack such genes. Here we report on the isolation of a MADS-box gene from Lycopodium annotinum, which belongs to the clubmosses, the phylogenetic sister group to other vascular plants. The gene, LAMB1, in the sporophyte is expressed exclusively in the reproductive structure, the strobilus, during sporogenesis. LAMB1 is similar to other plant MADS-box genes in that it contains a MADS-box as well as a second conserved element, a K-box. However, it differs in length and in exon/intron structure in the region between the MADS- and K-box, and also in the length and structure of the C-terminal region. A phylogenetic analysis indicates that LAMB1 is not closely related to other plant-type MADS-box genes, and may represent one of the basal branches in the phylogenetic tree of plant MADS-box genes.

abstract = {Photoperiodic control of the phase transition from vegetative to reproductive growth is critical for land plants. The GIGANTEA (GI) and FLAVIN-BINDING KELCH REPEAT F-BOX1 (FKF1) protein complex controls this process in angiosperms. However, little is known about how plants evolved this regulatory system. Here, we report that orthologues of GI and FKF1 are present in a basal plant, the liverwort Marchantia polymorpha, and describe the molecular interaction between their products. Knockout of either the GI or FKF1 orthologue completely abolishes the long-day-dependent growth-phase transition in M. polymorpha. Overexpression of either gene promotes growth-phase transition, even under short-day conditions. Introduction of the GI orthologue partially rescues the late-flowering phenotype of the Arabidopsis thaliana gi mutant. Our findings suggest that plants had already acquired the GI-FKF1 system to regulate growth-phase transition when they colonized land, and that this system was co-opted from gametophyte to sporophyte generation during evolution. Flowering is triggered by changes in day length, which are detected by a network of genes including GI and FKF1. Kubota et al. show that GI and FKF1homologues control transition from vegetative- to reproductive growth in the liverwort, revealing a more ancient than expected evolutionary origin for flowering control.},

Their mode of sexual reproduction is heterosporous. The regulation of the transition from the vegetative phase to the spore forming phase in ferns is largely unknown, yet a prerequisite for Azolla domestication, and of particular interest as ferns represent the sister lineage of seed plants. Sporocarps induced with far red light could be crossed so as to verify species attribution of strains from the Netherlands but not of the strain from the Anzali lagoon in Iran; the latter strain was assigned to a novel species cluster from South America. Red-dominated light suppresses the formation of dissemination stages in both gametophyte- and sporophyte-dominated lineages of plants, the response likely is a convergent ecological strategy to open fields. FR-responsive transcripts included those from MIKCC homologues of CMADS1 and miR319-controlled GAMYB transcription factors in the fern, transporters in N. azollae, and ycf2 in chloroplasts. Loci of conserved microRNA (miRNA) in the fern lineage included miR172, yet FR only induced miR529 and miR535, and reduced miR319 and miR159.

abstract = {BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Cyanobacteria associated with mosses represent a main nitrogen (N) source in pristine, high-latitude and -altitude ecosystems due to their ability to fix N2. However, despite progress made regarding moss-cyanobacteria associations, the factors driving the large interspecific variation in N2 fixation activity between moss species remain elusive. The aim of the study was to identify the traits of mosses that determine cyanobacterial colonization and thus N2 fixation activity. METHODS: Four moss species varying in N2 fixation activity were used to assess cyanobacterial abundance and activity to correlate it with moss traits (morphological, chemical, water-balance traits) for each species. KEY RESULTS: Moss hydration rate was one of the pivotal traits, explaining 56 and 38 {\%} of the variation in N2 fixation and cyanobacterial colonization, respectively, and was linked to morphological traits of the moss species. Higher abundance of cyanobacteria was found on shoots with smaller leaves, and with a high frequency of leaves. High phenol concentration inhibited N2 fixation but not colonization. These traits driving interspecific variation in cyanobacterial colonization, however, are also affected by the environment, and lead to intraspecific variation. Approximately 24 {\%} of paraphyllia, filamentous appendages on Hylocomium splendens stems, were colonized by cyanobacteria. CONCLUSIONS: Our findings show that interspecific variations in moss traits drive differences in cyanobacterial colonization and thus, N2 fixation activity among moss species. The key traits identified here that control moss-associated N2 fixation and cyanobacterial colonization could lead to improved predictions of N2 fixation in different moss species as a function of their morphology.},

We demonstrate the use of dRep for genome recovery from time-series datasets. Each metagenome was assembled separately, and dRep was used to identify groups of essentially identical genomes and select the best genome from each replicate set.

abstract = {Cyanobacteria are the only known prokaryotes capable of oxygenic photosynthesis, the evolution of which transformed the biology and geochemistry of Earth. The rapid increase in published genomic sequences of cyanobacteria provides the first opportunity to reconstruct events in the evolution of oxygenic photosynthesis on the scale of entire genomes. Here, we demonstrate the overall phylogenetic incongruence among 682 orthologous protein families from 13 genomes of cyanobacteria. However, using principal coordinates analysis, we discovered a core set of 323 genes with similar evolutionary trajectories. The core set is highly conserved in amino acid sequence and contains genes encoding the major components in the photosynthetic and ribosomal apparatus. Many of the key proteins are encoded by genome-wide conserved small gene clusters, which often are indicative of protein-protein, protein-prosthetic group, and protein-lipid interactions. We propose that the macromolecular interactions in complex protein structures and metabolic pathways retard the tempo of evolution of the core genes and hence exert a selection pressure that restricts piecemeal horizontal gene transfer of components of the core. Identification of the core establishes a foundation for reconstructing robust organismal phylogeny in genome space. Our phylogenetic trees constructed from 16S rRNA gene sequences, concatenated orthologous proteins, and the core gene set all suggest that the ancestral cyanobacterium did not fix nitrogen and probably was a thermophilic organism. {\textcopyright} 2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.},

abstract = {Motivation: Most non-coding RNAs are characterized by a specific secondary and tertiary structure that determines their function. Here, we investigate the folding energy of the secondary structure of non-coding RNA sequences, such as microRNA precursors, transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs in several eukaryotic taxa. Statistical biases are assessed by a randomization test, in which the predicted minimum free energy of folding is compared with values obtained for structures inferred from randomly shuffling the original sequences. Results: In contrast with transfer RNAs and ribosomal RNAs, the majority of the microRNA sequences clearly exhibit a folding free energy that is considerably lower than that for shuffled sequences, indicating a high tendency in the sequence towards a stable secondary structure. A possible usage of this statistical test in the framework of the detection of genuine miRNA sequences is discussed. {\textcopyright} Oxford University Press 2004; all rights reserved.},

abstract = {Currently, examination of the cellular structure of plant organs and the gene expression therein largely relies on the production of tissue sections. Here, we present a staining technique that can be used to image entire plant organs using confocal laser scanning microscopy. This technique produces high-resolution images that allow three-dimensional reconstruction of the cellular organization of plant organs. Importantly, three-dimensional domains of gene expression can be analyzed with single-cell precision. We used this technique for a detailed examination of phloem cells in the wild type and mutants. We were also able to recognize phloem sieve elements and their differentiation state in any tissue type and visualize the structure of sieve plates. We show that in the altered phloem development mutant, a hybrid cell type with phloem and xylem characteristics develops from initially normally differentiated protophloem cells. The simplicity of sieve element data collection allows for the statistical analysis of structural parameters of sieve plates, essential for the calculation of phloem conductivity. Taken together, this technique significantly improves the speed and accuracy of the investigation of plant growth and development. {\textcopyright} 2008 American Society of Plant Biologists.},

While regulatory factors determining male and female sexual morphologies have been identified for sporophytic reproductive organs, such as stamens and pistils of angiosperms, those regulating sex-specific traits in the haploid gametophytes that produce male and female gametes and hence are central to plant sexual reproduction are poorly understood. Here, we identified a MYB-type transcription factor, MpFGMYB, as a key regulator of female sexual differentiation in the haploid-dominant dioicous liverwort, Marchantia polymorpha MpFGMYB is specifically expressed in females and its loss resulted in female-to-male sex conversion. Strikingly, MpFGMYB expression is suppressed in males by a cis-acting antisense gene SUF at the same locus, and loss-of-function suf mutations resulted in male-to-female sex conversion. Thus, the bidirectional transcription module at the MpFGMYB/SUF locus acts as a toggle between female and male sexual differentiation in M. polymorpha gametophytes. Arabidopsis thaliana MpFGMYB orthologs are known to be expressed in embryo sacs and promote their development. Thus, phylogenetically related MYB transcription factors regulate female gametophyte development across land plants.},

abstract = {Fermentation-based metabolism is an important ecosystem function often associated with environments rich in organic carbon, such as wetlands, sewage sludge and the mammalian gut. The diversity of microorganisms and pathways involved in carbon and hydrogen cycling in sediments and aquifers and the impacts of these processes on other biogeochemical cycles remain poorly understood. Here we used metagenomics and proteomics to characterize microbial communities sampled from an aquifer adjacent to the Colorado River at Rifle, CO, USA, and document interlinked microbial roles in geochemical cycling. The organic carbon content in the aquifer was elevated via acetate amendment of the groundwater occurring over 2 successive years. Samples were collected at three time points, with the objective of extensive genome recovery to enable metabolic reconstruction of the community. Fermentative community members include organisms from a new phylum, Melainabacteria, most closely related to Cyanobacteria, phylogenetically novel members of the Chloroflexi and Bacteroidales, as well as candidate phyla genomes (OD1, BD1-5, SR1, WWE3, ACD58, TM6, PER and OP11). These organisms have the capacity to produce hydrogen, acetate, formate, ethanol, butyrate and lactate, activities supported by proteomic data. The diversity and expression of hydrogenases suggests the importance of hydrogen metabolism in the subsurface. Our proteogenomic data further indicate the consumption of fermentation intermediates by Proteobacteria can be coupled to nitrate, sulfate and iron reduction. Thus, fermentation carried out by previously unknown members of sediment microbial communities may be an important driver of nitrogen, hydrogen, sulfur, carbon and iron cycling.},

abstract = {Phytochromes are red/far-red photoreceptors that play essential roles in diverse plant morphogenetic and physiological responses to light. Despite their functional significance, phytochrome diversity and evolution across photosynthetic eukaryotes remain poorly understood. Using newly available transcriptomic and genomic data we show that canonical plant phytochromes originated in a common ancestor of streptophytes (charophyte algae and land plants). Phytochromes in charophyte algae are structurally diverse, including canonical and non-canonical forms, whereas in land plants, phytochrome structure is highly conserved. Liverworts, hornworts and Selaginella apparently possess a single phytochrome, whereas independent gene duplications occurred within mosses, lycopods, ferns and seed plants, leading to diverse phytochrome families in these clades. Surprisingly, the phytochrome portions of algal and land plant neochromes, a chimera of phytochrome and phototropin, appear to share a common origin. Our results reveal novel phytochrome clades and establish the basis for understanding phytochrome functional evolution in land plants and their algal relatives. Phytochromes are red-light photoreceptors in plants that regulate key life cycle processes, yet their evolutionary origins are not well understood. Using transcriptomic and genomic data, Li et al.find that canonical plant phytochromes originated in a common ancestor of land plants and charophyte algae.},

abstract = {The symbiosis Azolla-Anabaena azollae, with a worldwide distribution in pantropical and temperate regions, is one of the most studied, because of its potential application as a biofertilizer, especially in rice fields, but also as an animal food and in phytoremediation. The cyanobiont is a filamentous, heterocystic cyanobacterium that inhabits the foliar cavities of the pteridophyte and the indusium on the megasporocarp (female reproductive structure). The classification and phylogeny of the cyanobiont is very controversial: from its morphology, it has been named Nostoc azollae, Anabaena azollae, Anabaena variabilis status azollae and recently Trichormus azollae, but, from its 16S rRNA gene sequence, it has been assigned to Nostoc and/or Anabaena, and from its phycocyanin gene sequence, it has been assigned as non-Nostoc and non-Anabaena. The literature also points to a possible co-evolution between the cyanobiont and the Azolla host, since dendrograms and phylogenetic trees of fatty acids, short tandemly repeated repetitive (STRR) analysis and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of nif genes and the 16S rRNA gene give a two-cluster association that matches the two-section ranking of the host (Azolla). Another controversy surrounds the possible existence of more than one genus or more than one species strain. The use of freshly isolated or cultured cyanobionts is an additional problem, since their morphology and protein profiles are different. This review gives an overview of how morphological, chemical and genetic analyses influence the classification and phylogeny of the cyanobiont and future research.},

PIF4 acts as a transcription factor for some miRNA genes and is necessary for the proper accumulation of miRNAs. DCL1, HYL1, and mature miRNAs play roles in the regulation of plant hypocotyl growth. These results uncovered a previously unknown crosstalk between miRNA biogenesis and red light signaling through the PIF4-dependent regulation of miRNA transcription and processing to affect red-light-directed plant photomorphogenesis.},

abstract = {Plants sense light and temperature changes to regulate flowering time. Here, we show that expression of the Arabidopsis florigen gene, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), peaks in the morning during spring, a different pattern than we observe in the laboratory. Providing our laboratory growth conditions with a red/far-red light ratio similar to open-field conditions and daily temperature oscillation is sufficient to mimic the FT expression and flowering time in natural long days. Under the adjusted growth conditions, key light signalling components, such as phytochrome A and EARLY FLOWERING 3, play important roles in morning FT expression. These conditions stabilize CONSTANS protein, a major FT activator, in the morning, which is probably a critical mechanism for photoperiodic flowering in nature. Refining the parameters of our standard growth conditions to more precisely mimic plant responses in nature can provide a powerful method for improving our understanding of seasonal response. The usual light conditions used in laboratories fail to mimic natural conditions. Here, by slightly modifying red/far-red ratios and temperature dynamics, the authors are able to faithfully reproduce natural spring flowering times and variation of the FT gene.},

abstract = {Heterosporous water ferns (Marsileaceae and Salviniaceae) are the only extant group of plants to have evolved heterospory since the Paleozoic. These ferns possess unusual reproductive structures traditionally termed "sporocarps." Using an evolutionary framework, we critically examine the complex homology issues pertaining to these structures. Comparative morphological study reveals that all heterosporous ferns bear indusiate sori on a branched, nonlaminate structure that we refer to as the sorophore; this expanded definition highlights homology previously obscured by the use of different terms. By using a homology-based concept, we aim to discontinue the use of historically and functionally based morphological terminology. We recognize the sorophore envelope as a structure that surrounds the sorophore and sori. The sorophore envelope is present in Marsileaceae as a sclerenchymatous sporocarp wall and in Azolla as a parenchymatous layer, but it is absent in Salvinia. Both homology assessments and phylogenetic character-state reconstructions using the Cretaceous fossil Hydropteris are consistent with a single origin of the sorophore envelope in heterosporous ferns. Consequently, we restrict the term "sporocarp" to a sorophore envelope and all it contains. Traditional usage of "sporocarp" is misleading because it implies homology for nonhomologous structures, and structures historically called sporocarps in Salviniaceae are more appropriately referred to as sori. {\textcopyright} 2006 by The University of Chicago.

However, very few complete genomes exist for plant cyanobionts, and therefore little is known about their genomic and functional diversity. Here, we present four complete genomes of cyanobacteria isolated from bryophytes. Nanopore long-read sequencing allowed us to obtain circular contigs for all the main chromosomes and most of the plasmids. We found that despite having a low 16S rRNA sequence divergence, the four isolates exhibit considerable genome reorganizations and variation in gene content. Furthermore, three of the four isolates possess genes encoding vanadium (V)-nitrogenase (vnf), which is uncommon among diazotrophs and has not been previously reported in plant cyanobionts. In two cases, the vnf genes were found on plasmids, implying possible plasmid-mediated horizontal gene transfers. Comparative genomic analysis of vnf-containing cyanobacteria further identified a conserved gene cluster. Many genes in this cluster have not been functionally characterized and would be promising candidates for future studies to elucidate V-nitrogenase function and regulation.},

The inner envelope may serve to restrict the symbionts to the cavity periphery. The inner envelope was similar in appearance to the outer envelope, which encloses the symbionts and hair cells within leaf cavities. Examination of the inner envelope using three different fixation procedures revealed that it was most distinct in fronds fixed in potassium permanganate, suggesting that it is membranelike in structure. The envelope was occasionally seen folded back upon itself or curled, which is also characteristic of a membranelike structure. Nevertheless, the envelope did not exhibit typical tripartite membrane ultrastructure. The occurrence of the inner envelope in Anabaena-free Azolla indicates that this envelope is of eubacterial or plant origin.},

We recently proposed the ultrafast bootstrap approximation (UFBoot) to reduce computing time while achievingmore unbiased branch supports than SBS undermildmodel violations. UFBoot has been steadily adopted as an efficient alternative to SBS and other bootstrap approaches. Here, we present UFBoot2, which substantially accelerates UFBoot and reduces the risk of overestimating branch supports due to polytomies or severe model violations. Additionally, UFBoot2 provides suitable bootstrap resampling strategies for phylogenomic data. UFBoot2 is 778 times (median) faster than SBS and 8.4 times (median) faster than RAxML rapid bootstrap on tested data sets. UFBoot2 is implemented in the IQ-TREE software package version 1.6 and freely.},

abstract = {Many practicing biologists accept that nothing in their discipline makes sense except in the light of evolution, and that natural selection is evolution's principal sense-maker. But what natural selection actually is (a force or a statistical outcome, for example) and the levels of the biological hierarchy (genes, organisms, species, or even ecosystems) at which it operates directly are still actively disputed among philosophers and theoretical biologists. Most formulations of evolution by natural selection emphasize the differential reproduction of entities at one or the other of these levels. Some also recognize differential persistence, but in either case the focus is on lineages of material things: even species can be thought of as spatiotemporally restricted, if dispersed, physical beings. Few consider-as “units of selection” in their own right-the processes implemented by genes, cells, species, or communities. “It's the song not the singer” (ITSNTS) theory does that, also claiming that evolution by natural selection of processes is more easily understood and explained as differential persistence than as differential reproduction. ITSNTS was formulated as a response to the observation that the collective functions of microbial communities (the songs) are more stably conserved and ecologically relevant than are the taxa that implement them (the singers). It aims to serve as a useful corrective to claims that “holobionts” (microbes and their animal or plant hosts) are aggregate “units of selection,” claims that often conflate meanings of that latter term. But ITSNS also seems broadly applicable, for example, to the evolution of global biogeochemical cycles and the definition of ecosystem function.},

abstract = {The transcription of photosynthesis genes encoded by the plastid genome is mainly mediated by a prokaryotic-type RNA polymerase called plastid-encoded plastid RNA polymerase (PEP). Standard PEP-dependent promoters resemble bacterial sigma-70-type promoters containing the so-called −10 and −35 elements. On the other hand, an unusual light- and stress-responsive promoter (psbD LRP) that is regulated by a 19-bp AAG-box immediately upstream of the −35 element has been mapped upstream of the psbD-psbC operon in some angiosperms. However, the occurrence of the AAG-box containing psbD LRP in plant evolution remains elusive. We have mapped the psbD promoters in eleven embryophytes at different evolutionary stages from liverworts to angiosperms. The psbD promoters were mostly mapped around 500–900 bp upstream of the psbD translational start sites, indicating that the psbD mRNAs have unusually long 5′ -UTR extensions in common. The −10 elements of the psbD promoter are well-conserved in all embryophytes, but not the −35 elements. We found that the AAG-box sequences are highly conserved in angiosperms and gymnosperms except for gnetaceae plants. Furthermore, partial AAG-box-like sequences have been identified in the psbD promoters of some basal embryophytes such as moss, hornwort, and lycophyte, whereas liverwort has the standard PEP promoter without the AAG-box. These results suggest that the AAG-box sequences of the psbD LRP may have evolved from a primitive type of AAG-box of basal embryophytes. On the other hand, monilophytes (ferns) use another type of psbD promoter composed of a distinct cis-element upstream of the potential −35 element. Furthermore, we found that psbD expression is not regulated by light in gymnosperms or basal angiosperms, although they have the well-conserved AAG-box sequences. Thus, it is unlikely that acquisition of the AAG-box containing psbD promoter is directly associated with light-induced transcription of the psbD-psbC operon. Light- and stress-induced transcription may have evolved independently and multiple times during terrestrial plant evolution.},

abstract = {Deciphering the mechanisms directing transcription factors (TFs) to specific genome regions is essential to understand and predict transcriptional regulation. TFs recognize short DNA motifs primarily through their DNA-binding domain. Some TFs also possess an oligomerization domain suspected to potentiate DNA binding but for which the genome-wide influence remains poorly understood. Here we focus on the LEAFY transcription factor, a master regulator of flower development in angiosperms. We have determined the crystal structure of its conserved amino-terminal domain, revealing an unanticipated Sterile Alpha Motif oligomerization domain. We show that this domain is essential to LEAFY floral function. Moreover, combined biochemical and genome-wide assays suggest that oligomerization is required for LEAFY to access regions with low-affinity binding sites or closed chromatin. This finding shows that domains that do not directly contact DNA can nevertheless have a profound impact on the DNA binding landscape of a TF. The LEAFY transcription factor is a master regulator of flower development in plants. Here the authors describe the structure of a LEAFY oligomerization domain and show that mutations that disrupt oligomerization alter its capacity to bind low affinity and poorly accessible target sites.},

abstract = {In response to competition for light from their neighbors, shade-intolerant plants flower precociously to ensure reproductive success and survival. However, the molecular mechanisms underlying this key developmental switch are not well understood. Here, we show that a pair of Arabidopsis transcription factors essential for phytochrome A signaling, FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL3 (FHY3) and FAR-RED IMPAIRED RESPONSE1 (FAR1), regulate flowering time by integrating environmental light signals with the miR156-SPL module-mediated aging pathway. We found that FHY3 and FAR1 directly interact with three flowering-promoting SQUAMOSA-PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE (SPL) transcription factors, SPL3, SPL4, and SPL5, and inhibit their binding to the promoters of several key flowering regulatory genes, including FRUITFUL (FUL), LEAFY (LFY), APETALA1 (AP1), and MIR172C, thus downregulating their transcript levels and delaying flowering. Under simulated shade conditions, levels of SPL3/4/5 proteins increase, whereas levels of FHY3 and FAR1 proteins decline, thus releasing SPL3/4/5 from FHY3/FAR1 inhibition to allow activation of FUL, LFY, AP1, and MIR172C and, consequently, early flowering. Taken together, these results unravel a novel mechanism whereby plants regulate flowering time by integrating environmental cues (such as light conditions) and an internal developmental program (the miR156-SPL module-mediated aging pathway). In response to shading, plants accelerate flowering. This study reveals that Arabidopsis FHY3 and FAR1 act to prevent precocious flowering by directly interacting with and interfering with the DNA-binding activity of three flowering-promoting transcription factors, SPL3/4/5, and consequently downregulating the expression levels of FRUITFUL, LEAFY, APETALA1, and MIR172C, thus delaying flowering.},

abstract = {The nutritional and physiological characteristics of 15 isolates from four species of the Azolla fern were determined. Although some minor variation existed in levels of urease activity, ability to utilize xylose, and formation of N 2 gas from NO 3 , all 15 isolates were rather similar and believed to represent a single species. These eubacteria exhibited aminopeptidase activity and became viscous when treated with KOH, similar to gram-negative organisms; however, the absence of lipopolysaccharide and 2-keto-3-deoxyoctonate in cell walls indicated that they are truly gram-positive organisms. They are unusual because peptidoglycan could not be detected during most of their growth cycle. The presence of lysine as the major diamino acid in cell wall hydrolysates, the inability to hydrolyze cellulose, and the distinctive developmental pattern with rods and “V” forms present during log phase, becoming progressively shorter until cocci dominated during stationary and death phases, indicated that these organisms belong to the genus Arthrobacter Conn and Dimmick. With the exception of the inability to hydrolyze gelatin, their characteristics are consistent with those of the type species, Arthrobacter globiformis Conn and Dimmick.},

abstract = {Background: Cyanobacteria of the genus Nostoc are capable of forming symbioses with a wide range of organism, including a diverse assemblage of cyanolichens. Only certain lineages of Nostoc appear to be able to form a close, stable symbiosis, raising the question whether symbiotic competence is determined by specific sets of genes and functionalities. Results: We present the complete genome sequencing, annotation and analysis of two lichen Nostoc strains. Comparison with other Nostoc genomes allowed identification of genes potentially involved in symbioses with a broad range of partners including lichen mycobionts. The presence of additional genes necessary for symbiotic competence is likely reflected in larger genome sizes of symbiotic Nostoc strains. Some of the identified genes are presumably involved in the initial recognition and establishment of the symbiotic association, while others may confer advantage to cyanobionts during cohabitation with a mycobiont in the lichen symbiosis. Conclusions: Our study presents the first genome sequencing and genome-scale analysis of lichen-associated Nostoc strains. These data provide insight into the molecular nature of the cyanolichen symbiosis and pinpoint candidate genes for further studies aimed at deciphering the genetic mechanisms behind the symbiotic competence of Nostoc. Since many phylogenetic studies have shown that Nostoc is a polyphyletic group that includes several lineages, this work also provides an improved molecular basis for demarcation of a Nostoc clade with symbiotic competence.},

abstract = {Optimal timing of flowering, a major determinant for crop productivity, is controlled by environmental and endogenous cues. Nutrients are known to modify flowering time; however, our understanding of how nutrients interact with the known pathways, especially at the shoot apical meristem (SAM), is still incomplete. Given the negative side-effects of nitrogen fertilization, it is essential to understand its mode of action for sustainable crop production. We investigated how a moderate restriction by nitrate is integrated into the flowering network at the SAM, to which plants can adapt without stress symptoms. This condition delays flowering by decreasing expression of SUPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CONSTANS 1 (SOC1) at the SAM. Measurements of nitrate and the responses of nitrate-responsive genes suggest that nitrate functions as a signal at the SAM. The transcription factors NIN-LIKE PROTEIN 7 (NLP7) and NLP6, which act as master regulators of nitrate signaling by binding to nitrate-responsive elements (NREs), are expressed at the SAM and flowering is delayed in single and double mutants. Two upstream regulators of SOC1 (SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE3 (SPL3) and SPL5) contain functional NREs in their promoters. Our results point at a tissue-specific, nitrate-mediated flowering time control in Arabidopsis thaliana.},

abstract = {Bourrat and Griffiths (Hist Philos Life Sci 40(2):33, 2018) have recently argued that most of the evidence presented by holobiont defenders to support the thesis that holobionts are evolutionary individuals is not to the point and is not even adequate to discriminate multispecies evolutionary individuals from other multispecies assemblages that would not be considered evolutionary individuals by most holobiont defenders. They further argue that an adequate criterion to distinguish the two categories is fitness alignment, presenting the notion of fitness boundedness as a criterion that allows divorcing true multispecies evolutionary individuals from other multispecies assemblages and provides an adequate criterion to single out genuine evolutionary multispecies assemblages. A consequence of their criterion is that holobionts, as conventionally defined by hologenome defenders, are not evolutionary individuals except in very rare cases, and for very specific host-symbiont associations. This paper is a critical response to Bourrat and Griffiths' arguments and a defence of the arguments presented by holobiont defenders. Drawing upon the case of the hologenomic basis of the evolution of sanguivory in vampire bats (Nat Ecol Evol 2:659–668, 2018), I argue that Bourrat and Griffiths overlook some aspects of the biological nature of the microbiome that justifies the thesis that holobionts are evolutionarily different to other multispecies assemblages. I argue that the hologenome theory of evolution should not define the hologenome as a collection of genomes, but as the sum of the host genome plus some traits of the microbiome which together constitute an evolutionary individual, a conception I refer to as the stability of traits conception of the hologenome. Based on that conception I argue that the evidence presented by holobiont defenders is to the point, and supports the thesis that holobionts are evolutionary individuals. In this sense, the paper offers an account of the holobiont that aims to foster a dialogue between hologenome advocates and hologenome critics.},

Here, we performed evolutionary analyses of plant R2R3-MYB TFs with dense coverage of streptophyte algae and embryophytes. Our analyses revealed that ancestral land plants exhibited 10 subfamilies of R2R3-MYB proteins, among which orthologs of seven subfamilies were present in chlorophytes and charophycean algae. We found that asymmetric gene duplication events in different subfamilies account for the expansion of R2R3-MYB proteins in embryophytes. We further discovered that the largest subfamily of R2R3-MYBs in land plants, subfamily VIII, emerged in the common ancestor of Zygnematophyceae and embryophytes. During plant terrestrialization, six duplication events gave rise to seven clades of subfamily VIII. Subsequently, this TF subfamily showed a tendency for expansion in bryophytes, lycophytes, and ferns and extensively diversified in ancestral gymnosperms and angiosperms in clades VIII-A-1, VIII-D, and VIII-E. In contrast to subfamily VIII, other subfamilies of R2R3-MYB TFs have remained less expanded across embryophytes. The findings regarding phylogenetic analyses, auxiliary motifs, and DNA-binding specificities provide insight into the evolutionary history of plant R2R3-MYB TFs and shed light on the mechanisms underlying the extensive expansion and subsequent sub- and neofunctionalization of these proteins.},

abstract = {Gibberellin (GA) controls pollen development in flowering plants via the GAMYB transcription factor. Here we show that GAMYB is conserved in Selaginella moellendorffii (lycophyte) and Physcomitrella patens (moss), although the former contains the GA signalling pathway, the latter does not. In the lycophyte, GA treatment promotes the outer wall development on microspores, whereas treatment with GA biosynthesis inhibitors disturbs its development. Contrary, in the moss, GAMYB homologue knockouts also produce abnormal spores that resemble Selaginella microspores treated with GA biosynthesis inhibitors and pollen grains of rice gamyb mutant. Moreover, the knockouts fail to develop male organs, instead ectopically forming female organs. Thus, before the establishment of the GA signalling pathway, basal land plants, including mosses, contained a GAMYB-based system for spore and sexual organ development. Subsequently, during the evolution from mosses to basal vascular plants including lycophytes, GA signalling might have merged to regulate this pre-existing GAMYB-based system. {\textcopyright} 2011 Macmillan Publishers Limited.

abstract = {The appropriate timing of flowering is critical for plant reproductive success. Although the FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT)-FD module plays crucial roles in the photoperiodic flowering pathway, the underlying mechanisms and signaling pathways involved still remain elusive. Here, we demonstrate that class II TCP transcription factors (TFs) integrate into the FT-FD complex to control floral initiation in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). Class II CINCINNATA (CIN) TCP TFs function as transcriptional activators by directly binding to the promoters of downstream floral meristem identity genes, such as APETALA1 (AP1). In addition, these TCPs directly interact with FD, a basic Leu zipper TF that plays a critical role in photoperiodic flowering, which further activates AP1 expression. Genetic analyses indicated that class II CIN TCP TFs function synergistically with FT and FD, to positively regulate flowering in an AP1-dependent manner. Thus, our results provide compelling evidence that class II CIN TCP TFs act directly at the AP1 promoter to enhance its transcription, thus further elucidating the molecular mechanisms underlying the regulation of photoperiodic flowering in Arabidopsis.},

Brown. Rabbit anti-dinitrogenase reductase antisera and goat anti-rabbit-immunoglobulin G antibody conjugated to colloidal gold were used as probes. Western blot analyses showed that a polypeptide of approx. 36 kDa (kdalton) was recognized in the symbionts of all three Azolla species and that the polyclonal sera used were monospecific. In all symbionts, nitrogenase was immunologically recognizable within heterocysts. It was absent from vegetative cells, and also from the akinetes of the A. caroliniana and A. pinnata symbionts. The differentiation of vegetative cells into heterocysts in all three symbionts was initiated by formation of additional external cell-wall layers and narrowing of the neck followed by loss of glycogen, mild vesiculation of thylakoid membranes, and the appearance of polar nodules. No nitrogenase was detected at these early stages, but it appeared in the intermediate proheterocyst stage concomitantly with the formation of contorted membranes, and reached the strongest labeling in mature heterocysts, containing extensive tightly packed membranes. Nitrogenase was evenly distributed throughout heterocysts except at the polar regions, which contained honey-comb configurations and large polar nodules. With increased age of the A. caroliniana and A. pinnata symbionts, heterocysts became highly vesiculated, with a concomitant decrease in the amount of nitrogenase detected. {\textcopyright} 1988 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {The biological relevance of non-protein coding RNAs in the regulation of critical plant processes has been firmly established in recent years. This has been mostly achieved with the discovery and functional characterization of small non-coding RNAs, such as small interfering RNAs and microRNAs (miRNAs). However, recent next-generation sequencing techniques have widened our view of the non-coding RNA world, which now includes long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs). Small and lncRNAs seem to diverge in their biogenesis and mode of action, but growing evidence highlights their relevance in developmental processes and in responses to particular environmental conditions. Light can affect MIRNA gene transcription, miRNA biogenesis, and RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC) activity, thus controlling not only miRNA accumulation but also their biological function. In addition, miRNAs can mediate several light-regulated processes. In the lncRNA world, few reports are available, but they already indicate a role in the regulation of photomorphogenesis, cotyledon greening, and photoperiod-regulated flowering. In this review, we will discuss how light controls MIRNA gene expression and the accumulation of their mature forms, with a particular emphasis on those miRNAs that respond to different light qualities and are conserved among species. We will also address the role of small non-coding RNAs, particularly miRNAs, and lncRNAs in the regulation of light-dependent pathways. We will mainly focus on the recent progress done in understanding the interconnection between these non-coding RNAs and photomorphogenesis, circadian clock function, and photoperiod-dependent flowering.},

Fast programs exist, but due to inherent heuristics to find optimal trees, it is not clear whether the best tree is found. Thus, there is need for additional approaches that employ different search strategies to find ML trees and that are at the same time as fast as currently available ML programs. We show that a combination of hill-climbing approaches and a stochastic perturbation method can be time-efficiently implemented. If we allow the same CPU time as RAxML and PhyML, then our software IQ-TREE found higher likelihoods between 62.2{\%} and 87.1{\%} of the studied alignments, thus efficiently exploring the tree-space. If we use the IQ-TREE stopping rule, RAxML and PhyML are faster in 75.7{\%} and 47.1{\%} of the DNA alignments and 42.2{\%} and 100{\%} of the protein alignments, respectively.

abstract = {Bacterial symbionts bring a wealth of functions to the associations they participate in, but by doing so, they endanger the genes and genomes underlying these abilities. When bacterial symbionts become obligately associated with their hosts, their genomes are thought to decay towards an organelle-like fate due to decreased homologous recombination and inefficient selection. However, numerous associations exist that counter these expectations, especially in marine environments, possibly due to ongoing horizontal gene flow. Despite extensive theoretical treatment, no empirical study thus far has connected these underlying population genetic processes with long-term evolutionary outcomes. By sampling marine chemosynthetic bacterial-bivalve endosymbioses that range from primarily vertical to strictly horizontal transmission, we tested this canonical theory. We found that transmission mode strongly predicts homologous recombination rates, and that exceedingly low recombination rates are associated with moderate genome degradation in the marine symbionts with nearly strict vertical transmission. Nonetheless, even the most degraded marine endosymbiont genomes are occasionally horizontally transmitted and are much larger than their terrestrial insect symbiont counterparts. Therefore, horizontal transmission and recombination enable efficient natural selection to maintain intermediate symbiont genome sizes and substantial functional genetic variation.},

abstract = {Background: Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is an extremely useful tool for molecular and evolutionary biology and there are several programs and algorithms available for this purpose. Although previous studies have compared the alignment accuracy of different MSA programs, their computational time and memory usage have not been systematically evaluated. Given the unprecedented amount of data produced by next generation deep sequencing platforms, and increasing demand for large-scale data analysis, it is imperative to optimize the application of software. Therefore, a balance between alignment accuracy and computational cost has become a critical indicator of the most suitable MSA program. We compared both accuracy and cost of nine popular MSA programs, namely CLUSTALW, CLUSTAL OMEGA, DIALIGN-TX, MAFFT, MUSCLE, POA, Probalign, Probcons and T-Coffee, against the benchmark alignment dataset BAliBASE and discuss the relevance of some implementations embedded in each program's algorithm. Accuracy of alignment was calculated with the two standard scoring functions provided by BAliBASE, the sum-of-pairs and total-column scores, and computational costs were determined by collecting peak memory usage and time of execution.Results: Our results indicate that mostly the consistency-based programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT outperformed the other programs in accuracy. Whenever sequences with large N/C terminal extensions were present in the BAliBASE suite, Probalign, MAFFT and also CLUSTAL OMEGA outperformed Probcons and T-Coffee. The drawback of these programs is that they are more memory-greedy and slower than POA, CLUSTALW, DIALIGN-TX, and MUSCLE. CLUSTALW and MUSCLE were the fastest programs, being CLUSTALW the least RAM memory demanding program.Conclusions: Based on the results presented herein, all four programs Probcons, T-Coffee, Probalign and MAFFT are well recommended for better accuracy of multiple sequence alignments. T-Coffee and recent versions of MAFFT can deliver faster and reliable alignments, which are specially suited for larger datasets than those encountered in the BAliBASE suite, if multi-core computers are available. In fact, parallelization of alignments for multi-core computers should probably be addressed by more programs in a near future, which will certainly improve performance significantly. {\textcopyright} 2014 Pais et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Background: Cyanobacteria belong to an ancient group of photosynthetic prokaryotes with pronounced variations in their cellular differentiation strategies, physiological capacities and choice of habitat. Sequencing efforts have shown that genomes within this phylum are equally diverse in terms of size and protein-coding capacity. To increase our understanding of genomic changes in the lineage, the genomes of 58 contemporary cyanobacteria were analysed for shared and unique orthologs. Results: A total of 404 protein families, present in all cyanobacterial genomes, were identified. Two of these are unique to the phylum, corresponding to an AbrB family transcriptional regulator and a gene that escapes functional annotation although its genomic neighbourhood is conserved among the organisms examined. The evolution of cyanobacterial genome sizes involves a mix of gains and losses in the clade encompassing complex cyanobacteria, while a single event of reduction is evident in a clade dominated by unicellular cyanobacteria. Genome sizes and gene family copy numbers evolve at a higher rate in the former clade, and multi-copy genes were predominant in large genomes. Orthologs unique to cyanobacteria exhibiting specific characteristics, such as filament formation, heterocyst differentiation, diazotrophy and symbiotic competence, were also identified. An ancestral character reconstruction suggests that the most recent common ancestor of cyanobacteria had a genome size of approx. 4.5 Mbp and 1678 to 3291 protein-coding genes, 4{\%}-6{\%} of which are unique to cyanobacteria today. Conclusions: The different rates of genome-size evolution and multi-copy gene abundance suggest two routes of genome development in the history of cyanobacteria. The expansion strategy is driven by gene-family enlargment and generates a broad adaptive potential; while the genome streamlining strategy imposes adaptations to highly specific niches, also reflected in their different functional capacities. A few genomes display extreme proliferation of non-coding nucleotides which is likely to be the result of initial expansion of genomes/gene copy number to gain adaptive potential, followed by a shift to a life-style in a highly specific niche (e.g. symbiosis). This transition results in redundancy of genes and gene families, leading to an increase in junk DNA and eventually to gene loss. A few orthologs can be correlated with specific phenotypes in cyanobacteria, such as filament formation and symbiotic competence; these constitute exciting exploratory targets. {\textcopyright} 2011 Larsson et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

abstract = {Motivation RNA-Seq is a powerful technology that delivers digital gene expression data. To measure expression strength at the gene level, one popular approach is direct read counting after aligning the reads to a reference genome/transcriptome. HTSeq is one of the most popular ways of counting reads, yet its slow running speed of poses a bottleneck to many RNA-Seq pipelines. Gene level counting programs also lack a robust scheme for quantifying reads that map to non-exonic genomic features, such as intronic and intergenic regions, even though these reads are prevalent in most RNA-Seq data.

Results In this paper we present VERSE, an RNA-Seq read counting tool which builds upon the speed of featureCounts and implements the counting modes of HTSeq. VERSE is more than 30x faster than HTSeq when computing the same gene counts. VERSE also supports a hierarchical assignment scheme, which allows reads to be assigned uniquely and sequentially to different types of features according to user-defined priorities.

Availability VERSE is implemented in C. It is built on top of featureCounts. VERSE is open source and can be downloaded freely from Github ({\textless}https://github.com/qinzhu/VERSE{\textgreater}).

abstract = {The regulation of CONSTANS (CO) gene expression is crucial to accurately measure changes in daylength, which influences flowering time in Arabidopsis thaliana. CO expression is under both transcriptional and posttranslational control mechanisms. We previously showed that the E3 ubiquitin ligase HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENES1 (HOS1) physically interacts with CO in Arabidopsis. This interaction is required to precisely modulate the timing of CO accumulation and, consequently, to maintain low levels of FLOWERING LOCUS T expression during the first part of the day. The data presented here demonstrate that HOS1 is involved in the red light-mediated degradation of CO that takes place in the early stages of the daylight period. Our results show that phytochrome B (phyB) is able to regulate flowering time, acting in the phloem companion cells, as previously described for CO and HOS1. Moreover, we reveal that phyB physically interacts with HOS1 and CO, indicating that the three proteins may be present in a complex in planta that is required to coordinate a correct photoperiodic response in Arabidopsis.},

abstract = {Background: Insertion sequences (ISs) are approximately 1 kbp long "jumping" genes found in prokaryotes. ISs encode the protein Transposase, which facilitates the excision and reinsertion of ISs in genomes, making these sequences a type of class I ("cut-and-paste") Mobile Genetic Elements. ISs are proposed to be involved in the reductive evolution of symbiotic prokaryotes. Our previous sequencing of the genome of the cyanobacterium 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, living in a tight perpetual symbiotic association with a plant (the water fern Azolla), revealed the presence of an eroding genome, with a high number of insertion sequences (ISs) together with an unprecedented large proportion of pseudogenes. To investigate the role of ISs in the reductive evolution of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, and potentially in the formation of pseudogenes, a bioinformatic investigation of the IS identities and positions in 47 cyanobacterial genomes was conducted. To widen the scope, the IS contents were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively in 20 other genomes representing both free-living and symbiotic bacteria. Results: Insertion Sequences were not randomly distributed in the bacterial genomes and were found to transpose short distances from their original location ("local hopping") and pseudogenes were enriched in the vicinity of IS elements. In general, symbiotic organisms showed higher densities of IS elements and pseudogenes than non-symbiotic bacteria. A total of 1108 distinct repeated sequences over 500 bp were identified in the 67 genomes investigated. In the genome of 'Nostoc azollae' 0708, IS elements were apparent at 970 locations (14.3{\%}), with 428 being full-length. Morphologically complex cyanobacteria with large genomes showed higher frequencies of IS elements, irrespective of life style. Conclusions: The apparent co-location of IS elements and pseudogenes found in prokaryotic genomes implies earlier IS transpositions into genes. As transpositions tend to be local rather than genome wide this likely explains the proximity between IS elements and pseudogenes. These findings suggest that ISs facilitate the reductive evolution in for instance in the symbiotic cyanobacterium 'Nostoc azollae' 0708 and in other obligate prokaryotic symbionts.},

@article{Lutz2011,
abstract = {BACKGROUND: High throughput sequencing (HTS) technologies have revolutionized the field of genomics by drastically reducing the cost of sequencing, making it feasible for individual labs to sequence or resequence plant genomes. Obtaining high quality, high molecular weight DNA from plants poses significant challenges due to the high copy number of chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA, as well as high levels of phenolic compounds and polysaccharides. Multiple methods have been used to isolate DNA from plants; the CTAB method is commonly used to isolate total cellular DNA from plants that contain nuclear DNA, as well as chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA. Alternatively, DNA can be isolated from nuclei to minimize chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA contamination.

RESULTS: We describe optimized protocols for isolation of nuclear DNA from eight different plant species encompassing both monocot and eudicot species. These protocols use nuclei isolation to minimize chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA contamination. We also developed a protocol to determine the number of chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA copies relative to the nuclear DNA using quantitative real time PCR (qPCR). We compared DNA isolated from nuclei to total cellular DNA isolated with the CTAB method. As expected, DNA isolated from nuclei consistently yielded nuclear DNA with fewer chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA copies, as compared to the total cellular DNA prepared with the CTAB method. This protocol will allow for analysis of the quality and quantity of nuclear DNA before starting a plant whole genome sequencing or resequencing experiment.

CONCLUSIONS: Extracting high quality, high molecular weight nuclear DNA in plants has the potential to be a bottleneck in the era of whole genome sequencing and resequencing. The methods that are described here provide a framework for researchers to extract and quantify nuclear DNA in multiple types of plants.},

Furthermore Arthrobacter may contribute to the production of the mucilage present in the algalpackets by excreting extracellular polysaccharides, which components can be involved in lectin binding with Azolla and Anabaena. Finally the IAA formation by Arthrobacter may influence the hormonal balance during the establishment of the association. {\textcopyright} 1993 Taylor {\&} Francis Group, LLC.},

abstract = {Questions about in vivo substrates for proanthocyanidin (PA) biosynthesis and condensation have not been resolved and wide gaps in the understanding of transport and biogenesis in ‘tannosomes' persist. Here we examined the evolution of PA biosynthesis in ferns not previously reported, asking what PAs are synthesised and how. Chemical and gene-expression analyses were combined to characterise PA biosynthesis, leveraging genome annotation from the floating fern Azolla filiculoides. In vitro assay and phylogenomics of PIP-dehydrogenases served to infer the evolution of leucoanthocyanidin reductase (LAR). Sporophyte-synthesised (epi)catechin polymers, averaging only seven subunits, accumulated to 5.3{\%} in A. filiculoides, and 8{\%} in A. pinnata biomass dry weight. Consistently, a LAR active in vitro was highly expressed in A. filiculoides. LAR, and paralogous fern WLAR-enzymes with differing substrate binding sites, represent an evolutionary innovation of the common ancestor of fern and seed plants. The specific ecological niche of Azolla ferns, a floating plant–microbe mat massively fixing CO2 and N2, shaped their metabolism in which PA biosynthesis predominates and employs novel fern LAR enzymes. Characterisation of in vivo substrates of these LAR, will help to shed light on the recently assigned and surprising dual catalysis of LAR from seed plants.},

abstract = {Conserved genomic context provides critical information for comparative evolutionary analysis. With the increase in numbers of sequenced plant genomes, synteny analysis can provide new insights into gene family evolution. Here, we exploit a network analysis approach to organize and interpret massive pairwise syntenic relationships. Specifically, we analyzed synteny networks of the MADS-box transcription factor gene family using 51 completed plant genomes. In combination with phylogenetic profiling, several novel evolutionary patterns were inferred and visualized from synteny network clusters. We found lineage-specific clusters that derive from transposition events for the regulators of floral development (APETALA3 and PI) and flowering time (FLC) in the Brassicales and for the regulators of root development (AGL17) in Poales. We also identified two large gene clusters that jointly encompass many key phenotypic regulatory Type II MADS-box gene clades (SEP1, SQUA, TM8, SEP3, FLC, AGL6, and TM3). Gene clustering and gene trees support the idea that these genes are derived from an ancient tandem gene duplication that likely predates the radiation of the seed plants and then expanded by subsequent polyploidy events. We also identified angiosperm-wide conservation of synteny of several other less studied clades. Combined, these findings provide new hypotheses for the genomic origins, biological conservation, and divergence of MADS-box gene family members.},

The availability of nitrates produced by this process often limits primary productivity and is an important determinant in plant community ecology and biodiversity. Chemoautotrophic prokaryotes are recognized as the main facilitators of this process, although heterotrophic nitrification by fungi may be significant under certain conditions. However, there has been neither biochemical nor ecological evidence to support nitrification by photoautotrophic plants. Here we show how certain legumes that accumulate the toxin, 3-nitropropionic acid, generate oxidized inorganic nitrogen in their shoots, which is returned to the soil in their litter. In nitrogen-fixing populations this 'new' nitrate and nitrite can be derived from the assimilation of nitrogen gas. Normally, the transformation of elemental nitrogen from the atmosphere into a fixed oxidized form (as nitrate) is represented in the nitrogen cycle as a multiphasic process involving several different organisms. We show how this can occur in a single photoautotrophic organism, representing a previously undescribed feature of this biogeochemical cycle.},

abstract = {How do we define the 'plant microbiome' and what is its significance to the plant genome? Before addressing what the microbiome is in relation to plants, it is important to first understand the concept of the microbiome; what this means in relation to the host becomes an extension of this working concept. Conceptualizing the microbiome requires a fusion of microbial ecology and bioinformatics, integrated with an understanding of both host biology and ecology. The analysis of microbiome structure and function was pioneered in studies of human hosts and has become widely recognized as essential to understanding genetic and functional capacity otherwise attributed to the host, including important aspects of metabolism and physiology. Plants are teeming with microbial organisms, including those that colonize internal tissues, in addition to those that adhere to external surfaces. Combined with the vast diversity of microorganisms in the soil rhizosphere, these plant-soil-associated microbes comprise the plant microbiome. The microbiome is intricately involved in plant health and serves as a reservoir of additional genes that plants can access when needed. Understanding the regulation of plant trait expression, hence plant performance and how this in turn impacts ecosystem function, requires that we study the impacts of the plant microbiome. Herein, the importance of the plant microbiome to plant genomics is addressed by defining the plant microbiome in relation to the ecology of the system with emphasis on habitats occurring belowground at the plant-soil interface, where focus is on the role of exudates as currency in this system. ?? 2014 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {Humans are currently confronted by many global challenges. These include achieving food security for a rapidly expanding population, lowering the risk of climate change by reducing the net release of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere due to human activity, and meeting the increasing demand for energy in the face of dwindling reserves of fossil energy and uncertainties about future reliability of supply. Legumes deliver several important services to societies. They provide important sources of oil, fiber, and protein-rich food and feed while supplying nitrogen (N) to agro-ecosystems via their unique ability to fix atmospheric N2 in symbiosis with the soil bacteria rhizobia, increasing soil carbon content, and stimulating the productivity of the crops that follow. However, the role of legumes has rarely been considered in the context of their potential to contribute to the mitigation of climate change by reducing fossil fuel use or by providing feedstock for the emerging biobased economies where fossil sources of energy and industrial raw materials are replaced in part by sustainable and renewable biomass resources. The aim of this review was to collate the current knowledge regarding the capacity of legumes to (1) lower the emissions of the key greenhouse gases carbon dioxide (CO2) and nitrous oxide (N2O) compared to N-fertilized systems, (2) reduce the fossil energy used in the production of food and forage, (3) contribute to the sequestration of carbon (C) in soils, and (4) provide a viable source of biomass for the generation of biofuels and other materials in future biorefinery concepts. We estimated that globally between 350 and 500 Tg CO2 could be emitted as a result of the 33 to 46 Tg N that is biologically fixed by agricultural legumes each year. This compares to around 300 Tg CO2 released annually from the manufacture of 100 Tg fertilizer N. The main difference is that the CO2 respired from the nodulated roots of N2-fixing legumes originated from photosynthesis and will not represent a net contribution to atmospheric concentrations of CO2, whereas the CO2 generated during the synthesis of N fertilizer was derived from fossil fuels. Experimental measures of total N2O fluxes from legumes and N-fertilized systems were found to vary enormously (0.03–7.09 and 0.09–18.16 kg N2O–N ha−1, respectively). This reflected the data being collated from a diverse range of studies using different rates of N inputs, as well as the large number of climatic, soil, and management variables known to influence denitrification and the portion of the total N lost as N2O. Averages across 71 site-years of data, soils under legumes emitted a total of 1.29 kg N2O–N ha−1 during a growing season. This compared to a mean of 3.22 kg N2O–N ha−1 from 67 site-years of N-fertilized crops and pastures, and 1.20 kg N2O–N ha−1 from 33 site-years of data collected from unplanted soils or unfertilized nonlegumes. It was concluded that there was little evidence that biological N2 fixation substantially contributed to total N2O emissions, and that losses of N2O from legume soil were generally lower than N-fertilized systems, especially when commercial rates of N fertilizer were applied. Elevated rates of N2O losses can occur following the termination of legume-based pastures, or where legumes had been green- or brown-manured and there was a rapid build-up of high concentrations of nitrate in soil. Legume crops and legume-based pastures use 35{\%} to 60{\%} less fossil energy than N-fertilized cereals or grasslands, and the inclusion of legumes in cropping sequences reduced the average annual energy usage over a rotation by 12{\%} to 34{\%}. The reduced energy use was primarily due to the removal of the need to apply N fertilizer and the subsequently lower N fertilizer requirements for crops grown following legumes. Life cycle energy balances of legume-based rotations were also assisted by a lower use of agrichemicals for crop protection as diversification of cropping sequences reduce the incidence of cereal pathogens and pests and assisted weed control, although it was noted that differences in fossil energy use between legumes and Nfertilized systems were greatly diminished if energy use was expressed per unit of biomass or grain produced. For a change in land use to result in a net increase C sequestration in soil, the inputs of C remaining in plant residues need to exceed the CO2 respired by soil microbes during the decomposition of plant residues or soil organic C, and the C lost through wind or water erosion. The net N-balance of the system was a key driver of changes in soil C stocks in many environments, and data collected from pasture, cropping, and agroforestry systems all indicated that legumes played a pivotal role in providing the additional organic N required to encourage the accumulation of soil C at rates greater than can be achieved by cereals or grasses even when they were supplied with N fertilizer. Legumes contain a range of compounds, which could be refined to produce raw industrial materials currently manufactured from petroleum-based sources, pharmaceuticals, surfactants, or food additives as valuable by-products if legume biomass was to be used to generate biodiesel, bioethanol, biojet A1 fuel, or biogas. The attraction of using leguminous material feedstock is that they do not need the inputs of N fertilizer that would otherwise be necessary to support the production of high grain yields or large amounts of plant biomass since it is the high fossil energy use in the synthesis, transport, and application of N fertilizers that often negates much of the net C benefits of many other bioenergy sources. The use of legume biomass for biorefineries needs careful thought as there will be significant trade-offs with the current role of legumes in contributing to the organic fertility of soils. Agricultural systems will require novel management and plant breeding solutions to provide the range of options that will be required to mitigate climate change. Given their array of ecosystem services and their ability to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, lower the use of fossil energy, accelerate rates of C sequestration in soil, and provide a valuable source of feedstock for biorefineries, legumes should be considered as important components in the development of future agroecosystems.},

abstract = {The MADS genes encode a family of transcription factors, some of which control the identities of flora organs in flowering plants. To understand the role of MADS genes in the evolution of floral organs, five MADS genes (CMADS1, 2, 3, 4, and 6) were cloned from the fern Ceratopteris richardii, a nonflowering plant. A gene tree of partial amino acid sequences of seed plant and fern MADS genes showed that the fern genes form three subfamilies. All members of one of the fern MADS subfamilies have additional amino-terminal amino acids, which is a synapomorphic character of the AGAMOUS subfamily of the flowering plant MADS genes. Their structural similarity indicates a sister relationship between the two subfamilies. The temporal and spatial patterns of expression of the five fern MADS genes were assessed by Northern blot analyses and in situ hybridizations. CMADS1, 2, 3, and 4 are expressed similarly in the meristematic regions and primordia of sporophyte shoots and roots, as well as in reproductive structures, including sporophylls and sporangial initials, although the amount of expression in each tissue is different in each gene. CMADS6 is expressed in gametophytic tissues but not in sporophytic tissues. The lack of organ-specific expression of MADS genes in the reproductive structures of the fern sporophyte may indicate that the restriction of MADS gene expression to specific reproductive organs and the specialization of MADS gene functions as homeotic selector genes in the flowering plant lineage were important in floral organ evolution.},

abstract = {Roots are the primary site of interaction between plants and microorganisms. To meet food demands in changing climates, improved yields and stress resistance are increasingly important, stimulating efforts to identify factors that affect plant productivity. The role of bacterial endophytes that reside inside plants remains largely unexplored, because analysis of their specific functions is impeded by difficulties in cultivating most prokaryotes. Here, we present the first metagenomic approach to analyze an endophytic bacterial community resident inside roots of rice, one of the most important staple foods. Metagenome sequences were obtained from endophyte cells extracted from roots of field-grown plants. Putative functions were deduced from protein domains or similarity analyses of protein-encoding gene fragments, and allowed insights into the capacities of endophyte cells. This allowed us to predict traits and metabolic processes important for the endophytic lifestyle, suggesting that the endorhizosphere is an exclusive microhabitat requiring numerous adaptations. Prominent features included flagella, plant-polymer- degrading enzymes, protein secretion systems, iron acquisition and storage, quorum sensing, and detoxification of reactive oxygen species. Surprisingly, endophytes might be involved in the entire nitrogen cycle, as protein domains involved in N2-fixation, denitrification, and nitrification were detected and selected genes expressed. Our data suggest a high potential of the endophyte community for plant-growth promotion, improvement of plant stress resistance, biocontrol against pathogens, and bioremediation, regardless of their culturability.},

abstract = {Cryptogamic species and their associated cyanobacteria have attracted the attention of biogeochemists because of their critical roles in the nitrogen cycle through symbiotic and asymbiotic biological fixation of nitrogen (BNF). BNF is mediated by the nitrogenase enzyme, which, in its most common form, requires molybdenum at its active site. Molybdenum has been reported as a limiting nutrient for BNF in many ecosystems, including tropical and temperate forests. Recent studies have suggested that alternative nitrogenases, which use vanadium or iron in place of molybdenum at their active site, might play a more prominent role in natural ecosystems than previously recognized. Here, we studied the occurrence of vanadium, the role of molybdenum availability on vanadium acquisition and the contribution of alternative nitrogenases to BNF in the ubiquitous cyanolichen Peltigera aphthosa s.l. We confirmed the use of the alternative vanadium-based nitrogenase in the Nostoc cyanobiont of these lichens and its substantial contribution to BNF in this organism. We also showed that the acquisition of vanadium is strongly regulated by the abundance of molybdenum. These findings show that alternative nitrogenase can no longer be neglected in natural ecosystems, particularly in molybdenum-limited habitats.},

abstract = {Phytochromes are plant photoreceptors important for development and adaptation to the environment. Phytochrome A (PHYA) is essential for the far-red (FR) high-irradiance responses (HIRs), which are of particular ecological relevance as they enable plants to establish under shade conditions. PHYA and HIRs have been considered unique to seed plants because the divergence of seed plants and cryptogams (e.g., ferns and mosses) preceded the evolution of PHYA. Seed plant phytochromes translocate into the nucleus and regulate gene expression. By contrast, there has been little evidence of a nuclear localization and function of cryptogam phytochromes. Here, we identified responses to FR light in cryptogams, which are highly reminiscent of PHYA signaling in seed plants. In the moss Physcomitrella patens and the fern Adiantum capillus-veneris, phytochromes accumulate in the nucleus in response to light. Although P. patens phytochromes evolved independently of PHYA, we have found that one clade of P. patens phytochromes exhibits the molecular properties of PHYA. We suggest that HIR-like responses had evolved in the last common ancestor of modern seed plants and cryptogams and that HIR signaling is more ancient than PHYA. Thus, other phytochromes in seed plants may have lost the capacity to mediate HIRs during evolution, rather than that PHYA acquired it. {\textcopyright} 2013 American Society of Plant Biologists.

abstract = {Floral initiation and floral organ development are both regulated by the phytohormone gibberellin (GA). For example, in short-day photoperiods, the Arabidopsis floral transition is strongly promoted by GA-mediated activation of the floral meristem-identity gene LEAFY. In addition, anther development and pollen microsporogenesis depend on GA-mediated opposition of the function of specific members of the DELLA family of GA-response repressors. We describe the role of a microRNA (miR159) in the regulation of short-day photoperiod flowering time and of anther development. MiR159 directs the cleavage of mRNA encoding GAMYB-related proteins. These proteins are transcription factors that are thought to be involved in the GA-promoted activation of LEAFY, and in the regulation of anther development. We show that miR159 levels are regulated by GA via opposition of DELLA function, and that both the sequence of miR159 and the regulation of miR159 levels by DELLA are evolutionarily conserved. Finally, we describe the phenotypic consequences of transgenic over-expression of miR159. Increased levels of miR159 cause a reduction in LEAFY transcript levels, delay flowering in short-day photoperiods, and perturb anther development. We propose that miR159 is a phytohormonally regulated homeostatic modulator of GAMYB activity, and hence of GAMYB-dependent developmental processes.},

In fact, it is a fairly straightforward process that can be learned quickly and applied effectively. This Protocol describes the several steps required to produce a phylogenetic tree from molecular data for novices. In the example illustrated here, the program MEGA is used to implement all those steps, thereby eliminating the need to learn several programs, and to deal with multiple file formats from one step to another (Tamura K, Peterson D, Peterson N, Stecher G, Nei M, Kumar S. 2011. MEGA5: molecular evolutionary genetics analysis using maximum likelihood, evolutionary distance, and maximum parsimony methods. Mol Biol Evol. 28:2731-2739). The first step, identification of a set of homologous sequences and downloading those sequences, is implemented by MEGA's own browser built on top of the Google Chrome toolkit. For the second step, alignment of those sequences, MEGA offers two different algorithms: ClustalW and MUSCLE. For the third step, construction of a phylogenetic tree from the aligned sequences, MEGA offers many different methods. Here we illustrate the maximum likelihood method, beginning with MEGA's Models feature, which permits selecting the most suitable substitution model. Finally, MEGA provides a powerful and flexible interface for the final step, actually drawing the tree for publication. Here a step-by-step protocol is presented in sufficient detail to allow a novice to start with a sequence of interest and to build a publication-quality tree illustrating the evolution of an appropriate set of homologs of that sequence.

The cyanobacterium is vertically transmitted between the plant generations, via vegetative fragmentation of the host or sexually within megasporocarps. In the latter process, subsets of the cyanobacterial population living endophytically in the Azolla leaves function as inocula for the new plant generations. Using electron microscopy and immunogold-labeling, the fate of the cyanobacterium during colonization and development of the megasporocarp was revealed. On entering the indusium chamber of the megasporocarps as small-celled motile cyanobacterial filaments (hormogonia), these differentiated into large thick-walled akinetes (spores) in a synchronized manner. This process was accompanied by cytoplasmic reorganizations and the release of numerous membrane vesicles, most of which contained DNA, and the formation of a highly structured biofilm. Taken together the data revealed complex adaptations in the cyanobacterium during its transition between plant generations.},

To address this limitation, we introduce a correction algorithm and assembly strategy that uses short, high-fidelity sequences to correct the error in single-molecule sequences. We demonstrate the utility of this approach on reads generated by a PacBio RS instrument from phage, prokaryotic and eukaryotic whole genomes, including the previously unsequenced genome of the parrot Melopsittacus undulatus, as well as for RNA-Seq reads of the corn (Zea mays) transcriptome. Our long-read correction achieves {\textgreater}99.9{\%} base-call accuracy, leading to substantially better assemblies than current sequencing strategies: in the best example, the median contig size was quintupled relative to high-coverage, second-generation assemblies. Greater gains are predicted if read lengths continue to increase, including the prospect of single-contig bacterial chromosome assembly.},

abstract = {Bacteria of the genus Burkholderia establish an obligate symbiosis with plant species of the Rubiaceae and Primulaceae families. The bacteria, housed within the leaves, are transmitted hereditarily and have not yet been cultured. We have sequenced and compared the genomes of eight bacterial leaf nodule symbionts of the Rubiaceae plant family. All of the genomes exhibit features consistent with genome erosion. Genes potentially involved in the biosynthesis of kirkamide, an insecticidal C 7 N aminocyclitol, are conserved in most Rubiaceae symbionts. However, some have partially lost the kirkamide pathway due to genome erosion and are unable to synthesize the compound. Kirkamide synthesis is therefore not responsible for the obligate nature of the symbiosis. More importantly, we find evidence of intra-clade horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events affecting genes of the secondary metabolism. This indicates that substantial gene flow can occur at the early stages following host restriction in leaf nodule symbioses. We propose that host-switching events and plasmid conjugative transfers could have promoted these HGTs. This genomic analysis of leaf nodule symbionts gives, for the first time, new insights in the genome evolution of obligate symbionts in their early stages of the association with plants.},

abstract = {In 2004, the SEED (http://pubseed.theseed.org/) was created to provide consistent and accurate genome annotations across thousands of genomes and as a platform for discovering and developing de novo annotations. The SEED is a constantly updated integration of genomic data with a genome database, web front end, API and server scripts. It is used by many scientists for predicting gene functions and discovering new pathways. In addition to being a powerful database for bioinformatics research, the SEED also houses subsystems (collections of functionally related protein families) and their derived FIGfams (protein families), which represent the core of the RAST annotation engine (http://rast.nmpdr.org/). When a new genome is submitted to RAST, genes are called and their annotations are made by comparison to the FIGfam collection. If the genome is made public, it is then housed within the SEED and its proteins populate the FIGfam collection. This annotation cycle has proven to be a robust and scalable solution to the problem of annotating the exponentially increasing number of genomes. To date, {\textgreater}12 000 users worldwide have annotated {\textgreater}60 000 distinct genomes using RAST. Here we describe the interconnectedness of the SEED database and RAST, the RAST annotation pipeline and updates to both resources.},

abstract = {Green plants (Viridiplantae) include around 450,000–500,000 species1,2 of great diversity and have important roles in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Here, as part of the One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative, we sequenced the vegetative transcriptomes of 1,124 species that span the diversity of plants in a broad sense (Archaeplastida), including green plants (Viridiplantae), glaucophytes (Glaucophyta) and red algae (Rhodophyta). Our analysis provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining the evolution of green plants. Most inferred species relationships are well supported across multiple species tree and supermatrix analyses, but discordance among plastid and nuclear gene trees at a few important nodes highlights the complexity of plant genome evolution, including polyploidy, periods of rapid speciation, and extinction. Incomplete sorting of ancestral variation, polyploidization and massive expansions of gene families punctuate the evolutionary history of green plants. Notably, we find that large expansions of gene families preceded the origins of green plants, land plants and vascular plants, whereas whole-genome duplications are inferred to have occurred repeatedly throughout the evolution of flowering plants and ferns. The increasing availability of high-quality plant genome sequences and advances in functional genomics are enabling research on genome evolution across the green tree of life. The One Thousand Plant Transcriptomes Initiative provides a robust phylogenomic framework for examining green plant evolution that comprises the transcriptomes and genomes of diverse species of green plants.},

abstract = {The elucidation of structure-affinity relationships in EF-hand proteins requires a reliable assay of divalent ion affinity. In principle, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) should be capable of furnishing estimates for Ca2+- and Mg2+-binding constants in these systems. And because the method yields the binding enthalpy directly, ITC can provide a more detailed view of binding energetics than methods that rely on45Ca2+or fluorescent indicators. For several reasons, however, it is generally not possible to extract reliable binding parameters from single ITC experiments. Ca2+affinity is often too high, and Mg2+affinity is invariably too low. Moreover, least-squares minimization of multisite systems may not afford a unique fit because of strong parameter correlations. This chapter outlines a strategy for analyzing two-site systems that overcomes these obstacles. The method-which involves simultaneous, or global, least-squares analysis of direct and competitive ITC data-yields binding parameters for both Ca2+and Mg2+. Application of the method is demonstrated for two systems. The S55D/E59D variant of rat $\alpha$-parvalbumin, noteworthy for its elevated metal ion affinity, binds divalent ions noncooperatively and is amenable to analysis using an independent two-site model. On the other hand, Phl p 7, a pollen-specific EF-hand protein from timothy grass, binds Ca2+with positive cooperativity. Divalent ion-binding data for the protein must be analyzed using a two-site Adair model. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Data analysis often entails a multitude of heterogeneous steps, from the application of various command line tools to the usage of scripting languages like R or Python for the generation of plots and tables. It is widely recognized that data analyses should ideally be conducted in a reproducible way. Reproducibility enables technical validation and regeneration of results on the original or even new data. However, reproducibility alone is by no means sufficient to deliver an analysis that is of lasting impact (i.e., sustainable) for the field, or even just one research group. We postulate that it is equally important to ensure adaptability and transparency. The former describes the ability to modify the analysis to answer extended or slightly different research questions. The latter describes the ability to understand the analysis in order to judge whether it is not only technically, but methodologically valid.Here, we analyze the properties needed for a data analysis to become reproducible, adaptable, and transparent. We show how the popular workflow management system Snakemake can be used to guarantee this, and how it enables an ergonomic, combined, unified representation of all steps involved in data analysis, ranging from raw data processing, to quality control and fine-grained, interactive exploration and plotting of final results.},

One male patient who had performed the operation on himself was interviewed and underwent a tongue motility assessment, as well as an ultrasound examination. Tongue motility was mildly reduced as a result of tissue scarring. Speech was rated to be fully intelligible and highly acceptable by 4 raters, although 2 raters noticed slight distortions of the sibilants /s/ and /z/. The 3-dimensional ultrasound demonstrated that the synergy of the 2 sides of the tongue was preserved. A notably deep posterior genioglossus furrow indicated compensation for the reduced length of the tongue blade. It is concluded that the tongue split procedure did not significantly affect the participant's speech intelligibility and tongue motility.},

abstract = {Summary: A common empirical observation in mutualistic interactions is the persistence of variation in partner quality and, in particular, the persistence of exploitative phenotypes. For mutualisms between hosts and symbionts, most mutualism theory assumes that exploiters always impose fitness costs on their host. We exposed legume hosts to mutualistic (nitrogen-fixing) and exploitative (non-nitrogen-fixing) symbiotic rhizobia in field conditions, and manipulated the presence or absence of insect herbivory to determine if the costly fitness effects of exploitative rhizobia are context-dependent. Exploitative rhizobia predictably reduced host fitness when herbivores were excluded. However, insects caused greater damage on hosts associating with mutualistic rhizobia, as a consequence of feeding preferences related to leaf nitrogen content, resulting in the elimination of fitness costs imposed on hosts by exploitative rhizobia. Our experiment shows that herbivory is potentially an important factor in influencing the evolutionary dynamic between legumes and rhizobia. Partner choice and host sanctioning are theoretically predicted to stabilize mutualisms by reducing the frequency of exploitative symbionts. We argue that herbivore pressure may actually weaken selection on choice and sanction mechanisms, thus providing one explanation of why host-based discrimination mechanisms may not be completely effective in eliminating nonbeneficial partners. {\textcopyright} 2014 New Phytologist Trust.},

abstract = {The publication of a complete genome sequence is usually accompanied by annotations of its genes. In contrast to protein coding genes, genes for ribosomal RNA (rRNA) are often poorly or inconsistently annotated. This makes comparative studies based on rRNA genes difficult. We have therefore created computational predictors for the major rRNA species from all kingdoms of life and compiled them into a program called RNAmmer. The program uses hidden Markov models trained on data from the 5S ribosomal RNA database and the European ribosomal RNA database project. A pre-screening step makes the method fast with little loss of sensitivity, enabling the analysis of a complete bacterial genome in less than a minute. Results from running RNAmmer on a large set of genomes indicate that the location of rRNAs can be predicted with a very high level of accuracy. Novel, unannotated rRNAs are also predicted in many genomes. The software as well as the genome analysis results are available at the CBS web server.},

abstract = {Background: Saturated brines are extreme environments of low diversity. Salinibacter ruber is the only bacterium that inhabits this environment in significant numbers. In order to establish the extent of genetic diversity in natural populations of this microbe, the genomic sequence of reference strain DSM 13855 was compared to metagenomic fragments recovered from climax saltern crystallizers and obtained with 454 sequencing technology. This kind of analysis reveals the presence of metagenomic islands, i.e. highly variable regions among the different lineages in the population. Results: Three regions of the sequenced isolate were scarcely represented in the metagenome thus appearing to vary among co-occurring S. ruber cells. These metagenomic islands showed evidence of extensive genomic corruption with atypically low GC content, low coding density, high numbers of pseudogenes and short hypothetical proteins. A detailed analysis of island gene content showed that the genes in metagenomic island 1 code for cell surface polysaccharides. The strain-specific genes of metagenomic island 2 were found to be involved in biosynthesis of cell wall polysaccharide components. Finally, metagenomic island 3 was rich in DNA related enzymes. Conclusion: The genomic organisation of S. ruber variable genomic regions showed a number of convergences with genomic islands of marine microbes studied, being largely involved in variable cell surface traits. This variation at the level of cell envelopes in an environment devoid of grazing pressure probably reflects a global strategy of bacteria to escape phage predation. {\textcopyright} 2009 Pa{\v{s}}i{\'{c}} et al; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.},

We established a procedure to prepare sporangia of M. polymorpha under laboratory conditions by promoting its transition to reproductive development by far-red light irradiation. Here we report an improved direct transformation system of M. polymorpha using immature thalli developing from spores. Hygromycin-resistant transformants were obtained on selective media by transformation with a plasmid carrying the hygromycin-phosphotransferase gene (hpt) conferring hygromycin resistance in 4 weeks. The aminoglycoside-3″-adenyltransferase gene (aadA) conferring spectinomycin resistance was also successfully used as an additional selectable marker for nuclear transformation of M. polymorpha. The availability of the aadA gene in addition to the hpt gene should make M. polymorpha a versatile host for genetic manipulation. DNA gel-blot analyses indicated that transformed thalli carried a variable number of copies of the transgene integrated into the genome. Although the previous system using thalli grown from gemmae required a two-step selection in liquid and solid media for 8 weeks, the system reported here using thalli developing from spores allows generation of transformants in half the time by direct selection on solid media, facilitating genetic analyses in this model plant. {\textcopyright} 2008 Springer-Verlag.},

abstract = {CRISPR-Cas nucleases are powerful tools for manipulating nucleic acids; however, targeted insertion of DNA remains a challenge, as it requires host cell repair machinery. Here we characterize a CRISPR-associated transposase from cyanobacteria Scytonema hofmanni (ShCAST) that consists of Tn7-like transposase subunits and the type V-K CRISPR effector (Cas12k). ShCAST catalyzes RNA-guided DNA transposition by unidirectionally inserting segments of DNA 60 to 66 base pairs downstream of the protospacer. ShCAST integrates DNA into targeted sites in the Escherichia coli genome with frequencies of up to 80{\%} without positive selection. This work expands our understanding of the functional diversity of CRISPR-Cas systems and establishes a paradigm for precision DNA insertion.},

abstract = {Motivation: Fixed nitrogen is an essential requirement for the biosynthesis of cellular nitrogenous compounds. Some cyanobacteria can fix nitrogen, contributing significantly to the nitrogen cycle, agriculture and biogeochemical history of Earth. The rate and position on the species phylogeny of gains and losses of this ability, as well as of the underlying nif genes, are controversial. Results: We use probabilistic models of trait evolution to investigate the presence and absence of cyanobacterial nitrogen-fixing ability. We estimate rates of change on the species phylogeny, pinpoint probable changes and reconstruct the state and nif gene complement of the ancestor. Our results are consistent with a nitrogen-fixing cyanobacterial ancestor, repeated loss of nitrogen fixation and vertical descent, with little horizontal transfer of the genes involved. {\textcopyright} The Author 2012.

abstract = {Biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) performed by moss-associated cyanobacteria is one of the main sources of new nitrogen (N) input in pristine, high-latitude ecosystems. Yet, the nutrients that limit BNF remain elusive. Here, we tested whether this important ecosystem function is limited by the availability of molybdenum (Mo), phosphorus (P), or both. BNF in dominant mosses was measured with the acetylene reduction assay (ARA) at different time intervals following Mo and P additions, in both laboratory microcosms with mosses from a boreal spruce forest and field plots in subarctic tundra. We further used a 15N2 tracer technique to assess the ARA to N2 fixation conversion ratios at our subarctic site. BNF was up to four-fold higher shortly after the addition of Mo, in both the laboratory and field experiments. A similar positive response to Mo was found in moss colonizing cyanobacterial biomass. As the growing season progressed, nitrogenase activity became progressively more P limited. The ARA : 15N2 ratios increased with increasing Mo additions. These findings show that N2 fixation activity as well as cyanobacterial biomass in dominant feather mosses from boreal forests and subarctic tundra are limited by Mo availability.},

Immunoblot analyses showed that Ws lacks phyD but contains normal levels of phyA, phyB, and phyC. By backcrossing into the Ws and Landsberg erecta genetic backgrounds, we constructed sibling pairs of PHYD+ and phyD-1 lines and of phyB- PHYD+ and phyB- phyD- lines. Hypocotyl lengths after growth under white or red light increased sequentially in strains that were B+D+, B+D-, B-D+, and B-D-. In the Ws genetic background, an increase in petiole length, a reduction in cotyledon area and in anthocyanin accumulation in seedling stems, a diminished effect of an end-of-day pulse of far-red light on hypocotyl elongation, and a decrease in the number of rosette leaves at the onset of flowering were also seen sequentially in these lines. Thus, phyD, which is {\~{}}80{\%} identical in amino acid sequence to phyB, acts in conjunction with phyB in regulating many shade avoidance responses. The existence of the apparently naturally occurring phyD-1 mutation indicates that phyD is not essential in some natural environments.},

abstract = {3-Nitropropionate (3-NPA) is a nitro aliphatic compound found in numerous plants and fungi. The nitro compound exists in equilibrium with its conjugate base, propionate 3-nitronate (P3N) and has a pKa approaching the physiological range of 9.1. Since 1920, more than 30 species of plant and fungi have been identified as producing 3-NPA as a means of defense from herbivores. Glycoside products containing moieties of 3-NPA found in parts of the plants most accessible to herbivores can be easily hydrolyzed to free 3-NPA by bacterial enzymes in the gut of animals. In addition to providing a defense mechanism, the nitro compound is an intermediate in the nitrification process of leguminous plants. The synthesis of 3-NPA in these plants and fungi is poorly understood. P3N, which readily forms from 3-NPA at physiological pH, is a potent inhibitor of the key enzyme succinate dehydrogenase in the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain. Inhibition of succinate dehydrogenase in humans and livestock causes neurotoxicity and in some cases death. Several enzymes catalyze the oxidation of 3-NPA or P3N; all contain a noncovalently bound flavin cofactor and are found in the organisms that produce 3-NPA. With k cat/Km values of {\textgreater}106 M-1 s -1, nitronate monooxygenases can quickly and efficiently oxidize P3N to malonic semialdehyde as a means of protecting the organism from killing itself. Although it was discovered almost a century ago, the biochemistry and physiological role of 3-NPA/P3N are just emerging. {\textcopyright} 2013 IUBMB Life, 65(9):759-768, 2013 {\textcopyright} 2013 International Union of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology.},

Here, using random shotgun sequencing of DNA from a natural acidophilic biofilm, we report reconstruction of near-complete genomes of Leptospirillum group II and Ferroplasma type II, and partial recovery of three other genomes. This was possible because the biofilm was dominated by a small number of species populations and the frequency of genomic rearrangements and gene insertions or deletions was relatively low. Because each sequence read came from a different individual, we could determine that single-nucleotide polymorphisms are the predominant form of heterogeneity at the strain level. The Leptospirillum group II genome had remarkably few nucleotide polymorphisms, despite the existence of low-abundance variants. The Ferroplasma type II genome seems to be a composite from three ancestral strains that have undergone homologous recombination to form a large population of mosaic genomes. Analysis of the gene complement for each organism revealed the pathways for carbon and nitrogen fixation and energy generation, and provided insights into survival strategies in an extreme environment.},

abstract = {Viruses infecting prokaryotic cells (phages) are the most abundant entities of the biosphere and contain a largely uncharted wealth of genomic diversity. They play a critical role in the biology of their hosts and in ecosystem functioning at large. The classical approaches studying phages require isolation from a pure culture of the host. Direct sequencing approaches have been hampered by the small amounts of phage DNA present in most natural habitats and the difficulty in applying meta-omic approaches, such as annotation of small reads and assembly. Serendipitously, it has been discovered that cellular metagenomes of highly productive ocean waters (the deep chlorophyll maximum) contain significant amounts of viral DNA derived from cells undergoing the lytic cycle. We have taken advantage of this phenomenon to retrieve metagenomic fosmids containing viral DNA from a Mediterranean deep chlorophyll maximum sample. This method allowed description of complete genomes of 208 new marine phages. The diversity of these genomes was remarkable, contributing 21 genomic groups of tailed bacteriophages of which 10 are completely new. Sequence based methods have allowed host assignment to many of them. These predicted hosts represent a wide variety of important marine prokaryotic microbes like members of SAR11 and SAR116 clades, Cyanobacteria and also the newly described low GC Actinobacteria. A metavirome constructed from the same habitat showed that many of the new phage genomes were abundantly represented. Furthermore, other available metaviromes also indicated that some of the new phages are globally distributed in low to medium latitude ocean waters. The availability of many genomes from the same sample allows a direct approach to viral population genomics confirming the remarkable mosaicism of phage genomes.},

abstract = {We describe a new method (T-Coffee) for multiple sequence alignment that provides a dramatic improvement in accuracy with a modest sacrifice in speed as compared to the most commonly used alternatives. The method is broadly based on the popular progressive approach to multiple alignment but avoids the most serious pitfalls caused by the greedy nature of this algorithm. With T-Coffee we pre-process a data set of all pair-wise alignments between the sequences. This provides us with a library of alignment information that can be used to guide the progressive alignment. Intermediate alignments are then based not only on the sequences to be aligned next but also on how all of the sequences align with each other. This alignment information can be derived from heterogeneous sources such as a mixture of alignment programs and/or structure superposition. Here, we illustrate the power of the approach by using a combination of local and global pair-wise alignments to generate the library. The resulting alignments are significantly more reliable, as determined by comparison with a set of 141 test cases, than any of the popular alternatives that we tried. The improvement, especially clear with the more difficult test cases, is always visible, regardless of the phylogenetic spread of the sequences in the tests. (C) 2000 Academic Press.},

abstract = {Cyanobacteria of the genus Trichodesmium provide about 80 Tg of fixed nitrogen to the surface ocean per year and contribute to marine biogeochemistry, including the sequestration of carbon dioxide. Trichodesmium fixes nitrogen in the daylight, despite the incompatibility of the nitrogenase enzyme with oxygen produced during photosynthesis. While the mechanisms protecting nitrogenase remain unclear, all proposed strategies require considerable resource investment. Here we identify a crucial benefit of daytime nitrogen fixation in Trichodesmium spp. that may counteract these costs. We analysed diel proteomes of cultured and field populations of Trichodesmium in comparison with the marine diazotroph Crocosphaera watsonii WH8501, which fixes nitrogen at night. Trichodesmium's proteome is extraordinarily dynamic and demonstrates simultaneous photosynthesis and nitrogen fixation, resulting in balanced particulate organic carbon and particulate organic nitrogen production. Unlike Crocosphaera, which produces large quantities of glycogen as an energy store for nitrogenase, proteomic evidence is consistent with the idea that Trichodesmium reduces the need to produce glycogen by supplying energy directly to nitrogenase via soluble ferredoxin charged by the photosynthesis protein PsaC. This minimizes ballast associated with glycogen, reducing cell density and decreasing sinking velocity, thus supporting Trichodesmium's niche as a buoyant, high-light-adapted colony forming cyanobacterium. To occupy its niche of simultaneous nitrogen fixation and photosynthesis, Trichodesmium appears to be a conspicuous consumer of iron, and has therefore developed unique iron-acquisition strategies, including the use of iron-rich dust. Particle capture by buoyant Trichodesmium colonies may increase the residence time and degradation of mineral iron in the euphotic zone. These findings describe how cellular biochemistry defines and reinforces the ecological and biogeochemical function of these keystone marine diazotrophs.},

abstract = {In a world of global warming, the question emerges whether all plants have suitable mechanisms to keep pace with the rapidly changing environment. Most previous studies have focused on either the ability of plants to rapidly acclimatize via physiological and developmental plasticity, or long-term adaptation over thousands of years. However, we wonder whether plants can also adapt to changes in the environment within only a few generations. We hypothesize that rapidly evolving clusters of tandemly duplicated developmental control genes represent a source for fast adaptation. Specifically, we propose that a tandem cluster of FLC-like MADS-box genes involved in the transition to flowering in Arabidopsis functions as a facilitator for rapid adaptation to changes in ambient temperature.},

abstract = {MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short, single stranded RNA molecules that regulate the stability and translation of messenger RNAs in diverse eukaryotic groups. Several miRNA genes are of ancient origin and have been maintained in the genomes of animal and plant taxa for hundreds of millions of years, playing key roles in development and physiology. In the last decade, genome and small RNA (sRNA) sequencing of several plant species have helped unveil the evolutionary history of land plants. Among these, the fern group (monilophytes) occupies a key phylogenetic position, as it represents the closest extant cousin taxon of seed plants, i.e. gymno-and angiosperms. However, in spite of their evolutionary, economic and ecological importance, no fern genome has been sequenced yet and few genomic resources are available for this group. Here, we sequenced the small RNA fraction of an epiphytic South American fern, Pleopeltis minima (Polypodiaceae), and compared it to plant miRNA databases, allowing for the identification of miRNA families that are shared by all land plants, shared by all vascular plants (tracheophytes) or shared by euphyllophytes (ferns and seed plants) only. Using the recently described transcriptome of another fern, Lygodium japonicum, we also estimated the degree of conservation of fern miRNA targets in relation to other plant groups. Our results pinpoint the origin of several miRNA families in the land plant evolutionary tree with more precision and are a resource for future genomic and functional studies of fern miRNAs.},

Short-lived annuals flower abundantly soon after germination, whereas longer-lived perennials postpone and spatially restrict flowering. We used CRISPR/Cas9 and interspecies gene transfer to understand divergence in reproductive patterns between annual and perennial crucifers. We show that in perennial Arabis alpina, flowering in response to winter cold depends on the floral integrator SQUAMOSA PROMOTER BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE 15 (SPL15), whose activity is limited to older shoots and branches during cold exposure. In annuals, this regulatory system is conserved, but cold-induced flowering occurs in young shoots, without requirement for SPL15, through the photoperiodic pathway when plants return to warm. By reconstructing the annual response in perennials, we conclude that characteristic patterns of reproduction in annuals and perennials are conferred through variation in dependency on distinct flowering pathways acting in parallel.},

To provide evolutionary and functional insights into this million-year old symbiosis, we investigate endophytic bacterial sub-communities isolated from coralloid roots of species from Dioon (Zamiaceae) sampled from their natural habitats. We employed a sub-community co-culture experimental strategy to reveal both predominant and rare bacteria, which were characterized using phylogenomics and detailed metabolic annotation. Diazotrophic plant endophytes, including Bradyrhizobium, Burkholderia, Mesorhizobium, Rhizobium, and Nostoc species, dominated the epiphyte-free sub-communities. Draft genomes of six cyanobacteria species were obtained after shotgun metagenomics of selected sub-communities. These data were used for whole-genome inferences that suggest two Dioon-specific monophyletic groups, and a level of specialization characteristic of co-evolved symbiotic relationships. Furthermore, the genomes of these cyanobacteria were found to encode unique biosynthetic gene clusters, predicted to direct the synthesis of specialized metabolites, mainly involving peptides. After combining genome mining with detection of pigment emissions using multiphoton excitation fluorescence microscopy, we also show that Caulobacter species co-exist with cyanobacteria, and may interact with them by means of a novel indigoidine-like specialized metabolite. We provide an unprecedented view of the composition of the cycad coralloid root, including phylogenetic and functional patterns mediated by specialized metabolites that may be important for the evolution of ancient symbiotic adaptations.},

Although this increasing breadth of draft genomes is providing key information regarding the evolutionary and functional diversity of microbial life, it has become impractical to finish all available reference genomes. Making robust biological inferences from draft genomes requires accurate estimates of their completeness and contamination. Current methods for assessing genome quality are ad hoc and generally make use of a limited number of "marker" genes conserved across all bacterial or archaeal genomes. Here we introduce CheckM, an automated method for assessing the quality of a genome using a broader set of marker genes specific to the position of a genome within a reference genome tree and information about the collocation of these genes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of CheckM using synthetic data and a wide range of isolate-, single-cell-, and metagenome-derived genomes. CheckM is shown to provide accurate estimates of genome completeness and contamination and to outperform existing approaches. Using CheckM, we identify a diverse range of errors currently impacting publicly available isolate genomes and demonstrate that genomes obtained from single cells and metagenomic data vary substantially in quality. In order to facilitate the use of draft genomes, we propose an objective measure of genome quality that can be used to select genomes suitable for specific gene- and genome-centric analyses of microbial communities.},

However, field surveys showed that the agent utilized another Azolla species, thought to be the native Azolla pinnata subsp. africana, which contradicted host specificity trials. It is notoriously difficult to determine Azolla species based on morphology so genetic analyses were required to confirm the identity of the Azolla used by the agent. Extensive sampling was conducted and samples were sequenced at the trnL-trnF and trnG-trnR chloroplastic regions and the nuclear ITS1 region. Current literature reported A. filiculoides as the only Section Azolla species in southern Africa but 24 samples were identified as Azolla cristata, an introduced species within Section Azolla that was not used during host specificity trials. A. pinnata subsp. africana was only located at one site in southern Africa, while the alien A. pinnata subsp. asiatica was located at three. What was thought to be A. pinnata subsp. africana was in fact A. cristata, a closer relative of A. filiculoides and a suitable host according to specificity trials. This study confirms that S. rufinasus is a proficient Azolla taxonomist but also supports the use of molecular techniques for resolving taxonomic conundrums.},

abstract = {Application of indoleacetic acid (IAA) at a concentration of 2–10 µg ml–1 significantly enhanced the sporulation frequency and number of microsporocarps per plant in Azolla microphylla (two strains), Azolla caroliniana and Azolla pinnata. An increase in the number of megasporocarps was observed in A. microphylla at 4 µg ml–1 and 6 µg ml–1 and in A. caroliniana and A. pinnata at all the concentrations. The optimal IAA concentration for the sporulation of the three Azolla species was 6 µg ml–1. Application of IAA at this level increased the sporulation frequency and number of total sporocarps per plant by 39.3–99.5{\%} and 56.9–91.1{\%} over the control, respectively. The increase in the number of megasporocarps was more than that of the microsporocarps. In view of an almost similar response of different Azolla species to IAA, only the two A. microphylla strains with year-round sporulation were used in the subsequent investigations. In these strains, application of napthaleneacetic acid (NAA) and indolebutyric acid (IBA) at a concentration of 2–10 µg ml–1 also increased the sporulation frequency and sporocarp number significantly and the optimal concentration was 6 µg ml–1. Gibberellic acid (GA3; 2.5 µg ml–1) was more effective than IAA, NAA and IBA (6 µg ml–1) for enhancing the sporulation frequency and microsporocarp number but not the megasporocarp number. Application of one of the auxins plus GA3 had some synergistic effects and led to the formation of more megasporocarps, while maintaining the sporulation frequency and microsporocarp number to the level of the treatment with GA3 alone. This practice could be advantageous for the production of Azolla sporocarps because it is the megasporocarps that generate new plants after fertilization and germination.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2018 John Wiley  {\&}  Sons Ltd. Plants sense and respond to microbes utilizing a multilayered signalling cascade. In seed plants, the phytohormones jasmonic and salicylic acid (JA and SA) are key denominators of how plants respond to certain microbes. Their interplay is especially well-known for tipping the scales in plants' strategies of dealing with phytopathogens. In non-angiosperm lineages, the interplay is less well understood, but current data indicate that it is intertwined to a lesser extent and the canonical JA/SA antagonism appears to be absent. Here, we used the water fern Azolla filiculoides to gain insights into the fern's JA/SA signalling and the molecular communication with its unique nitrogen fixing cyanobiont Nostoc azollae, which the fern inherits both during sexual and vegetative reproduction. By mining large-scale sequencing data, we demonstrate that Azolla has most of the genetic repertoire to produce and sense JA and SA. Using qRT-PCR on the identified biosynthesis and signalling marker genes, we show that Azolla is responsive to exogenously applied SA. Furthermore, exogenous SA application influenced the abundance and gene expression of Azolla's cyanobiont. Our data provide a framework for JA/SA signalling in ferns and suggest that SA might be involved in Azolla's communication with its vertically inherited cyanobiont.},

abstract = {Land plants associate with a root microbiota distinct from the complex microbial community present in surrounding soil. The microbiota colonizing the rhizosphere (immediately surrounding the root) and the endophytic compartment (within the root) contribute to plant growth, productivity, carbon sequestration and phytoremediation. Colonization of the root occurs despite a sophisticated plant immune system, suggesting finely tuned discrimination of mutualists and commensals from pathogens. Genetic principles governing the derivation of host-specific endophyte communities from soil communities are poorly understood. Here we report the pyrosequencing of the bacterial 16S ribosomal RNA gene of more than 600 Arabidopsis thaliana plants to test the hypotheses that the root rhizosphere and endophytic compartment microbiota of plants grown under controlled conditions in natural soils are sufficiently dependent on the host to remain consistent across different soil types and developmental stages, and sufficiently dependent on host genotype to vary between inbred Arabidopsis accessions. We describe different bacterial communities in two geochemically distinct bulk soils and in rhizosphere and endophytic compartments prepared from roots grown in these soils. The communities in each compartment are strongly influenced by soil type. Endophytic compartments from both soils feature overlapping, low-complexity communities that are markedly enriched in Actinobacteria and specific families from other phyla, notably Proteobacteria. Some bacteria vary quantitatively between plants of different developmental stage and genotype. Our rigorous definition of an endophytic compartment microbiome should facilitate controlled dissection of plant-microbe interactions derived from complex soil communities.},

A wide spectrum of microbes frequently occurs in Genlisea's leaf-derived traps without clear relevance for Genlisea carnivory. We sequenced the metatranscriptomes of subterrestrial traps versus the aerial chlorophyll-containing leaves of G. nigrocaulis and of G. hispidula. Ribosomal RNA assignment revealed soil-borne microbial diversity in Genlisea traps, with 92 genera of 19 phyla present in more than one sample. Microbes from 16 of these phyla including proteobacteria, green algae, amoebozoa, fungi, ciliates and metazoans, contributed additionally short-lived mRNA to the metatranscriptome. Furthermore, transcripts of 438 members of hydrolases (e.g. proteases, phosphatases, lipases), mainly resembling those of metazoans, ciliates and green algae, were found. Compared to aerial leaves, Genlisea traps displayed a transcriptional up-regulation of endogenous NADH oxidases generating reactive oxygen species as well as of acid phosphatases for prey digestion. A leaf-versus-trap transcriptome comparison reflects that carnivory provides inorganic P- and different forms of N-compounds (ammonium, nitrate, amino acid, oligopeptides) and implies the need to protect trap cells against oxidative stress. The analysis elucidates a complex food web inside the Genlisea traps, and suggests ecological relationships between this plant genus and its entrapped microbiome.},

The software package can be used to prepare high-quality whole genome submissions to NCBI. The software package is user-friendly and includes validation and editing tools to fix errors as part of preparing the submission.},

abstract = {Summary: The Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) format is a generic alignment format for storing read alignments against reference sequences, supporting short and long reads (up to 128 Mbp) produced by different sequencing platforms. It is flexible in style, compact in size, efficient in random access and is the format in which alignments from the 1000 Genomes Project are released. SAM tools implements various utilities for post-processing alignments in the SAM format, such as indexing, variant caller and alignment viewer, and thus provides universal tools for processing read alignments. {\textcopyright} 2009 The Author(s).},
