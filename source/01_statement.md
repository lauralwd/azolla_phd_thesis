\footnote{
The awarding of a doctorate is traditionally paired with the new doctor declaring to from then on, do science ethically, with integrity, and thoroughly.
Before the thesis defense, this is considered the responsibility of the supervisors, the university, or the academic system as a whole.
Although I understand the reasoning, I respectfully disagree.
I would advocate entrusting PhDs with the shared responsibility of integrity.
This statement is my way of proactively setting straight this oddity in the system.
