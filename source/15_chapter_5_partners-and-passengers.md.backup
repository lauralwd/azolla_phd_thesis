Goal: identify the microbes that are more stably associated with the Azolla genus, and hypothesise what they may do.

Q: Are these even the same bacteria:
A: ANI network of all microbes from hidden treasures, plus the ones from databases/papers associated to Azolla.

Q: (presumably) Some look alike, do they share some history with Azolla?
A: Per phylum? trees to see if they're one Azolla associated group, and do they show some co-evolution

Q: Do they show signs of genome degradation:
A: Score pseudogenes

Q: What can we say about functionality?
A: GO enrichment against a phylum/family representable group? Any hits in the dual RNA-seq maybe...

future: kicking out microbes, and reintroducing them.
