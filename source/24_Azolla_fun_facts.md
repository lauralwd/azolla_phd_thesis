# The Azolla event

The _Azolla_ event is a spectacular story.
So much so, that I often ended up poster presentations talking only about this geological fun-fact, rather than my own work.
I hereby challenge my thesis committee not to mention the _Azolla_ event once during my defence.
That being said, this hitch-hiker's guide is not complete without the story.
Especially so, since it was this research line by Utrecht University geologists that brought _Azolla_ to the attention of the biology department [@Bijl2014].
A sequence of events that culminated in the Utrecht _Azolla_ lab being born.
A sequence of events that I will shortly reminisce on; this being the last PhD thesis produced by said Utrecht _Azolla_ lab.

During geological expeditions drilling for Arctic sediment cores, some peculiar structures were found [@Brinkhuis2006].
This discovery started an intriguing investigation into how one small plant affected Earth's climatic history.
During the Arctic Coring Expedition (ACEX), researchers found strange arrow-shaped microfossils in a specific layer of all sediment cores.
While initially puzzled, scientists eventually identified these as glochidia.
These are the specialised microspore structures of _Azolla_.
The widespread presence of glochidia indicated that the Arctic Ocean had once been covered with mats of _Azolla_.

Detailed analyses of the sediment cores revealed that _Azolla_ blooms persisted in the Arctic Ocean for nearly a million years during the Eocene epoch, around 49 million years ago.
This period was characterized by nutrient-rich freshwater layers on the ocean surface, created by significant river runoff.
The arctic ocean was more enclosed by landmasses then, fresh water supplied by multiple rivers made at least the top layer of this ocean fresh.
These conditions facilitated the rapid growth and spread of _Azolla_, which formed dense mats across the Arctic.
As these ferns photosynthesised, they absorbed large amounts of atmospheric CO$_2$ [@Speelman2009].
When they died and sank to the ocean floor, the carbon they had captured was buried in the anoxic sediments.
This effectively sequestered the CO$_2$ and reduced greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere.
We now call this the Azolla Event.

The Azolla Event's impact on global climate was profound, contributing significantly to the transition from a greenhouse to an icehouse Earth.
The extensive carbon sequestration by _Azolla_ helped to initiate a global cooling trend.
It lead to the formation of polar ice caps and a shift towards the current icehouse climate.

A popular question is if we can use _Azolla_ to mitigate current greenhouse gas emissions.
Whilst this is a tempting thought, the _Azolla_ event took place on the entire North pole area, for over a million years.
Whatever would have grown in that ocean, would have died due to the invasive spread of _Azolla_ ferns.
I suspect it was an ecological disaster on it's own, perhaps a small extinction event even.
Humanity currently does not have the space, time, nor can we withstand such an ecological disaster.
_Azolla_ is not a greenhouse-gas get-out-of-fail-free-card.
It is my opinion that greenhouse gas emissions should still be tackled at the source.

# The Salviniales Order

Nothing in biology makes sense except in the light of evolution.
Therefore, let's have a look at _Azolla_'s closest relatives.
The order Salviniales comprises two families of heterosporous aquatic ferns: Salviniaceae and Marsileaceae.
These families are distinguished from other ferns by their adaptation to aquatic habitats and their unique reproductive structures.
The entire order is heterosporous: producing both megaspores and microspores within sporocarp structures.
_Azolla_ is part of the Salviniaceae family and is the only genus that has a symbiosis with cyanobacteria.

## Marsileaceae Family

The Marsileaceae family includes genera such as _Marsilea_, _Pilularia_, and _Regnellidium_.
These ferns grow in wet or aquatic environments.
They are typically rooted in substrate with leaves that float on the water surface or are suspended above it.
The Marsileaceae family its appearance is rather similar to the popular iron-cross chamber plant, but then aquatic and a fern.
Marsileaceae members are characterized by their four-lobed leaves (in _Marsilea_) or cylindrical leaves (in _Pilularia_).
This form  differs substantially from the floating leaf structures seen in Salviniaceae. [@Campbell1893]

## Salviniaceae Family

The Salviniaceae family consists of two genera: _Azolla_ and _Salvinia_.
These ferns are adapted to float on water as a whole and are often found in ponds, lakes, and slow-moving streams.
Members of Salviniaceae produce spores in sporocarps, similar to Marsileaceae, but they exhibit distinct morphological traits.
Their leaves are covered in hydrophobic trichomes that prevent the leaves from submergence.
_Salvinia cuculata_ its trichomes are notable for they make little whisks.
_Salvinia_ species leaves are attached to the stem in groups of three, with two floating leaves and one modified into a root-like structure.
This morphology supports the shoot-like origin for _Azolla_ roots as discussed before.
Like _Azolla_, _Salivinia_ species are often seen as rapid invasive growers.
In eutrophic ecosystems, specifically _Salvinia_ cuculata can cover a water surface fast, and effectively suffogate the submerged aquatic life.

_Azolla_ is the only genus in the order with a symbiotic relationship with nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria, _T azollae_.
_Azolla_ species have a competitive advantage in eutrophic ecosystems with low-nitrogen.
Between six and eight species are currently recognised, each with a specific global distribution.
Here I maintain a list of six species:

* _Azolla filiculoides_
* _Azolla rubra_
* _Azolla caroliniana_
* _Azolla microphylla_
* _Azolla pinatta_
* _Azolla nilotica_

<!-- Maybe insert map with each their geographical distribution. -->
